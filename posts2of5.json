Jealousy is a very complex emotion that often includes touches of anger, frustration, fear, sadness, and even depression.<sup>(3)</sup> In romantic relationships, jealousy originates from the feeling that one’s relationship is at risk, which are often caused by various belief patterns and experiences.<sup>(3)(6)</sup> Maybe you have experienced jealousy when you compared yourself to the hot bartender that tried flirting with your significant other? Or maybe a past relationship led you to develop trust issues and that feeling of doubt is always wriggling in the back of your mind?</p>\n<p>It’s important to recognize that these feelings are completely natural, and potentially even helpful. Research suggests jealousy has an evolutionary advantage which motivates us to strengthen our relationship when faced with a threat. Specifically, these feelings and their associated actions are believed to secure paternity for males and maintain security and resources for females.<sup>(3)</sup> However, extreme jealousy can actually become a threat to the relationship itself when it interferes with one or both partner’s <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/your-partner-doesnt-trust-you/\">trust and freedom</a>. Consider the following tips to protect your relationship from the negative effects of jealousy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2><b>Reflect on the Meaning of your Feelings</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the most basic ways to fight against feelings of jealousy is to understand exactly <i>why</i> you feel jealous. It might seem obvious on the surface, but there is often a deeper reason why the green-eyed monster is popping his head over your shoulder. It may seem tempting to blame your partner’s behavior for your feelings of jealousy, but many sources of jealousy are actually internal! Jealousy in relationships often stems from feelings of insecurity or the desire to control your partner. Interestingly, the desire to control your partner can also originate from deeper feelings of insecurity! <sup>(2)(6)</sup></p>\n<p>However, beyond recognizing the internal origins of your feelings, it is often beneficial to reflect on the specific moments that incited the jealousy.<sup>(2)</sup> Are there certain things your partner does which remind you of an ex who strayed? Or perhaps you only feel jealous when your partner hangs around “that friend”. Pinpointing specific events that triggered feelings of jealousy can shed light on why you felt jealous in the first place.<sup>(2)</sup> Even more importantly, it can tell you what situations you can try to avoid or at least prepare for to minimize the effects of jealousy.<sup>(4)</sup></p>\n<p>At the same time, it is important to try not to get caught up in the feeling of jealousy itself. Sometimes when we think back on specific memories or events, we can get caught up in those negative emotions and fall into a <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/is-anxiety-interfering-with-your-relationship-2/\">cycle of negativity</a>. This is what psychologists call “rumination”. It might be difficult, but try your best to avoid “re-playing” the scenes in your head. Instead, use them solely as reference, and focus on how these events affected you. <sup>(1)</sup></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h2><b>Have an Open Discussion with Your Partner</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you have taken time to understand your own jealous feelings, try to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/is-lack-of-communication-a-problem-in-your-relationship/\">communicate</a> this understanding with your partner. Let your partner know that you’d like to talk and find a quiet place and time when you won’t be interrupted. You deserve a space to share your feelings and the inciting events. At the same time, your partner deserves a space to share their side of the story. Together, partners should work to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/5-things-you-can-do-to-protect-and-strengthen-your-relationship/\">establish boundaries and compromises</a> that can alleviate both partners’ concerns.<sup>(2)</sup> For instance, if your partner has a friend that makes you feel insecure, your partner may not find it fair to be forced to completely cut that person out of their life. However, perhaps a compromise to lessen the frequency of outings with that friend would work, or better yet, an increase in quality time with your partner instead!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, vulnerable discussions like these often lead to heightened emotions. If one partner feels persecuted or distressed, it could lead to anger, disappointment, frustration, or worse. For this reason, it is important that both parties attempt to limit destructive communication and behaviors. For a productive outcome, both partners should refrain from verbal or physical aggression and from weaponizing jealousy through intentionally making one another jealous. If either partner notices that emotions are flaring, take a break and continue the discussion later, after tempers have cooled. <sup>(4)</sup></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h2><b>Reaffirm the Relationship</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Beyond the boundaries and compromises of a couple’s open discussion, it may be beneficial for the two of you to intentionally reaffirm the security of the relationship. Little gestures can go a long way if they are genuine. If a partner is prone to jealousy, occasional reassurances of the relationship’s strength can work wonders! <sup>(4)(6)</sup></p>\n<p>Sometimes reassurance can be as simple as a few key words. There is nothing wrong with giving a bit of <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/ways-to-get-and-give-emotional-support-in-your-relationship/\">unsolicited support</a>, and there is nothing wrong with asking for reassurance in moments that you feel insecure or vulnerable. If you know that your partner has a tendency to get jealous in particular situations, you can make an effort to remind them of their meaning to you as a partner.<sup>(4)(6)</sup> And if you feel that words aren’t enough, small gifts can offer support as well! <sup>(6)</sup> Ideally, these <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/the-complete-guide-to-the-different-love-languages-and-what-they-mean/\">affirmations and gifts</a> should go both ways; if you are prone to jealousy, then your accommodating partner deserves assurance and gifts as well.</p>\n<p>These reassurances go a long way in open discussions as well. If your partner opens up to you about their jealous feelings (or about other vulnerabilities in their lives), then aim to accept these feelings as openly as possible. Try to avoid overly expressing defensiveness, but also don’t be afraid to assert your own feelings. Boundaries should be set by both parties; you can make compromises on how to fight against jealousy while still reaffirming your partner about their position in the relationship.<sup>(6)</sup></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h2><b>Consider Outside Help</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If open communication and compromises haven’t been successful, then you may wish to consider outside help.<sup>(3)</sup> Sometimes feelings of jealousy stem from sources that are difficult to work on without a third-party perspective, particularly if the feelings are long-lasting, frequent, and interfering with relationship satisfaction.<sup>(4)</sup></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.OurRelationship.com\">The OurRelationship program</a> is an excellent free (or low-cost) online resource for couples struggling with jealousy because it allows each partner to develop a DEEP understanding of the issue. In the program, partners learn about their Differences, External stressors, underlying Emotions, and Patterns of communication. Learning about each partner’s DEEP understanding fosters empathy and awareness within the relationship whenever jealousy arises in the future. Even further, the program guides the couple to make specific changes which may include avoiding situations that evoke jealousy or changing communication styles when a partner feels jealous. Throughout the program, couples meet virtually with a relationship coach to help them communicate their issue, DEEP understanding, and desired changes effectively.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>However, if you want to work through this issue more intensely with a therapist, couple therapy can also be a great resource.</p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p>Jealousy can be a difficult hurdle in any relationship, but it can be overcome with a little preparation and effort. Simply working with your partner can be enough to stabilize a relationship burdened by jealousy. Open, judgment-free communication and self-reflection are useful for various relationship problems even beyond jealousy. Implementing these tips and communicating openly with your partner should allow you to work together to overcome jealousy in any form.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>References</b></p>\n<p><sup>1 </sup>Elphinston, R.

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By: Milan Pasic </strong></p>\n<p>Recent psychological studies support a key strategy to improve your romantic relationships: have sex. This may seem obvious, but, upon closer examination, it isn’t as simple as you think. Sex in the context of relationships can seem simple or one-dimensional. You may view sex between monogamous partners as a way to satisfy each other’s needs, but its role in relationships is often deeper than that. In this article, we will first discuss the importance of a healthy sex life, then we will move onto the methods you can use to not only improve sexual satisfaction, but also improve the relationship as a whole.</p>\n<p>First, let’s talk about why sex is important for your personal well-being. Studies have long supported that sex is important. As humans, we have sexual needs and desires that can boil over in nasty ways if left unsatisfied. However, the importance of having sex goes beyond just meeting our evolutionary needs. In fact, unaddressed sexual desires can result in an overall decline in mental and physical health. It is also an intense source of affection within a relationship. When you are vulnerable with your partner in this way, you are choosing to share your body and desires with them which can create a bond and experience unique to sexual intimacy. Affection at such a high level communicates that your partner is attracted to you and trusts you. Now that we’ve established that sex, in general, is beneficial for you and your partner, let’s discuss what steps to take to have a healthier sex life that also benefits other areas of your relationship.</p>\n<h2><b>When you have the urge, tell your partner!</b></h2>\n<p>For several internal and external reasons, sex can be difficult to discuss. Due to anxiety or societal taboos, you might be nervous or embarrassed to discuss the sexual desires you have with your partner. As hard as it can be, communication is essential for better and healthy sex. One reason for this is simple &#8211; sex is better when both partners want it. Studies show that people have more frequent and better sex when sexual desire is higher. Open communication can help one another understand when each person desires sexual activity. If you find yourself wanting to have sex, do not hesitate to tell your partner. They may be feeling the same way! However, present your desires in a welcoming, pressure-free way, as it’s extremely important to only have sex if your partner shares your desire.</p>\n<h2><b>Discuss your specific desires and needs.</b></h2>\n<p>It’s also important to discuss the specifics of what you want and do not want in your sex life. Not only does this lead to better sex, but sexual communication is strongly associated with relationship satisfaction. If you have a sexual fantasy or desire that you are too shy to tell your partner, do your best to be open with them. If it’s difficult for you to discuss sex with your partner, you could show them what you want physically or work your way up from a desire you suspect they would be open to.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Open sexual communication improves more than sexual satisfaction. When you decide to share these thoughts with your partner you are telling them that you love and trust them enough to share your deepest and most private thoughts. This level of vulnerability can<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>bring you even closer to the one you love.</p>\n<h2><b>Create an emotionally welcoming environment.</b></h2>\n<p>Although communication is important, you should never force someone you love to discuss something that makes them uncomfortable or that they are not ready to share. It’s important to be aware of our partners’ feelings and behaviors when discussing intimate topics. It can be very difficult for some people, particularly those who tend to avoid situations that require them to open up about their emotions,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>If your partner falls into this category, try your best to create a warm environment by showing unconditional support and by communicating you would never judge them for who they are. Receiving the messages that you care for and accept them may encourage them to stay and talk with you rather than avoiding difficult conversations about sex. As we’ve explored, this communication can then lead to a healthier sex life, and more importantly, a happier relationship.</p>\n<p>The critical takeaway from this conversation is that communication and authentic sex is crucial for sexual and relationship satisfaction. Studies tell us that the expression “quality over quantity” applies to healthy sex lives as well. In fact, there is, at most, only a small correlation between sexual satisfaction and sexual frequency. However, sex can provide emotional and physical intimacy in a way that no other activity can. When you choose to share your physicality with your partner you can show love and trust in a very impactful manner. Try your best to communicate your sexual needs, frustrations, desires, and fears with your partner. First, have a conversation with your significant other about your sex life. Ask them if there’s anything about your current sexual relationship that they are unsatisfied with. Remember to be understanding and open to new ideas. Having these types of conversations can lead to a happier relationship with enhanced trust and intimacy.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Debrot, A., Meuwly, N., Muise, A., Impett, E.

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By: Valeria Palacios<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p>I arrived at my first Codependents Anonymous (CoDA) meeting 20 minutes early with no idea what to expect and a tremendous amount of nerves. My fear was big, but my feelings of emptiness and loss of self from not being able to let go of an extremely toxic relationship got me through the waiting. I was surprised to see the room fill up with about 50 people, mostly younger adults, with equal amounts of men and women. The severity of the stories ranged, but the feelings and attributes of codependence were all shared. I did not feel out of place, but rather left the meeting knowing that there is a lack of awareness for what codependency is and who is affected by it. I no longer wanted to be in codependent relationships that drained me, I wanted to build relationships with healthy boundaries. To make this change, I knew an important part of my recovery would be to explore where this dynamic originated. I hope to share my knowledge on the subject to help others who also wish to change.</p>\n<h2><b>What is codependency in terms of romantic relationships?</b></h2>\n<p>Codependence has been described as a condition that is manifested through a dysfunctional pattern of relating to others. Characteristics of this behavior pattern include extreme dependence and preoccupation with another person, extreme focus outside of the self, lack of open expression of feelings, and a drive to gain a sense of purpose through relationships<sup>4</sup>. The term codependency arose in the 1980s to describe the family members of substance abusers. A common example of “attempting to gain a sense of purpose through relationships” would be the wife of an alcoholic who endures all the difficulties resulting from her husband’s alcoholism but justifies her situation with the terms “he needs me”. She feels purposeful as her husband’s “fixer”<sup>10</sup>. A recurrent theme in the literature on codependency is the “loss of self”. The need to maintain a relationship, even an unhealthy one, is so powerful that codependent individuals tend to suppress their feelings, needs, and desires to please their partner<sup>4</sup>. A codependent person may not want to engage in a disagreement due to their fear of losing or upsetting their partner even if they feel strongly on the subject at hand. This cost of self-expression ultimately leads to identity disturbances<sup>4</sup>. Codependency has also been characterized as a set of self-defeating, learned behaviors that diminish the capacity to initiate and participate in healthy, loving relationships<sup>5</sup>. The keyword in such definitions is “learned”. It puts into question where do these codependent tendencies come from?</p>\n<h2><b>Where does codependency originate? Exploring the power of attachment style</b></h2>\n<p>Because attachment affects how people think, behave, and feel in close relationships, we must explore attachment theory to understand codependency<sup>3</sup>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Infants turn to their caregivers for support during times of fear, anxiety, or distress. These early experiences help the infant develop an internal representation of a “caregiver”<sup>3</sup>. Three principal attachment patterns emerge from these early caregiver interactions: secure attachment, insecure attachment (ambivalent or avoidant), and disorganized attachment. Attachment styles in infancy help predict various aspects of social development including the trajectory of adult romantic relationships<sup>1</sup>. Thus, there is a link between codependency in romantic relationships and in secure attachment styles starting in infancy. Insecure attachment in infancy comes from inconsistent availability from caregivers during times of distress. This type of inconsistent parenting during childhood can create a fixation on keeping people close. Many infants may grow up to worry that their needs can’t or won’t be met consistently. They may be preoccupied with abandonment and have expectations that others won’t be there for them<sup>2</sup>. By adolescence, these early attachment experiences and feelings towards caregivers are internalized and incorporated into our personalities<sup>2</sup>. Anxiously attached adults worry excessively about losing their romantic partners, are heavily invested in their relationship, have negative self-views, question their self-worth, and yearn to get closer emotionally to feel more secure<sup>5</sup>. People in codependent relationships rely on each other not for love and care, but for relief from these feelings of insecurity. It is safe to say that codependent individuals have some degree of anxious attachment as a result of negative early childhood experiences with their caregivers, which is manifested in their adult romantic relationships.</p>\n<h2><b>Common Codependent Behaviors</b><b><sup>5</sup></b><b>:</b></h2>\n<h4>● Being a caretaker</h4>\n<h4>● Controlling</h4>\n<h4>● High-stress levels</h4>\n<h4>● Tend to be people-pleasers</h4>\n<h4>● Want to feel needed</h4>\n<h4>● Fear of abandonment</h4>\n<h4>● Dependent on relationships</h4>\n<h4>● Hard time trusting others</h4>\n<h4>● Denial</h4>\n<h2><b>Is codependency bad? Tips on breaking the pattern of codependency</b></h2>\n<p>Codependent relationships are often unfulfilling and sometimes abusive. Codependent individuals are at a higher risk for other mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression<sup>2</sup>. Codependency leads to damaging relationships and deprives people of the chance to meet their own needs. Leaving codependent relationships and working on changing codependent tendencies allows you to have relationships that stem from love rather than necessity. Let’s explore some tips on making this change.</p>\n<h3><b>Contextualize your codependent tendencies and embrace healthy relationship characteristics you wish to improve (ex: lower your relationship anxiety)</b><b><sup>9</sup></b></h3>\n<p>Acknowledgment is the first step to healing and changing. Acknowledging anxious attachment and wanting to change has proven to decrease codependent tendencies. Research has found that people who acknowledge their wish to become more secure and less anxious in relationships decreased attachment anxiety at a faster rate than people who did not. Having such “change goals” will help you act less anxious and maintaining these change goals over a period of time causes them to become learned and habitual.</p>\n<h3><b>Look into Co-Dependents Anonymous Org. (meetings, webinars, etc.) </b><b><sup>10</sup></b><b> </b></h3>\n<p>Group therapies are effective for some codependent individuals. These group settings will help you acknowledge your relationship “addictions” while helping you to increase your self-esteem and self-worth. It also gives you a space to build networks and interests outside of your romantic relationship, which helps to build a sense of self. Co-Dependents Anonymous also has other resources such as books, workbooks, and podcasts to help in your recovery.</p>\n<h3><b>Practice meditation for anxiety relief within romantic relationships or moments of solitude</b><b><sup>11</sup></b></h3>\n<p>To decrease codependency, work on coping with the symptoms of anxiety which often stem from fears of abandonment, the need for control, fears of loneliness, etc. The practice of meditation, breathwork, and self-affirmation interventions, have all proven to be effective in decreasing anxiety. There are many apps and websites such as Headspace, Calm, and Buddhify that provide free meditation/breathwork exercises. Netflix and YouTube also have a wide range of guided meditations. With lower levels of anxiety, you can assess your fears from a more realistic point of view. This will help you cope with solitude and romantic relationships in a healthier manner.</p>\n<h2><b>Accepting Change</b></h2>\n<p>The good news is that change is possible. Studies have shown that by simply modifying your thoughts and behaviors to align with a desired trait, you can willingly change your attachment styles<sup>9</sup>. Working on being more secure in relationships has been associated with better functioning and more success in romantic relationships, better mental health (including less depressive and anxious symptoms), better physical health, higher friendship quality, and even better cognitive processes such as memory and attention<sup>9</sup>. Although it isn’t always easy, overcoming codependency will open the doors for you to engage in more loving relationships not only with a romantic partner, but also with yourself. It is important to be accepting and forgiving towards yourself during this time of healing. Just like I learned during my first CoDA meeting, you are not alone, and people can and do overcome codependence.</p>\n<p><b>References</b></p>\n<p><sup>1.</sup>Cassidy, J., &amp; Berlin, L. J.

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By: Ryley Howard<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p>An ideal-partner checklist of someone dating in the 21<sup>st</sup> century might include requirements such as: has a good career, similar education, makes me laugh, is the right height, and gets along with my parents. However, not everyone considers the importance of their partner’s religious beliefs. A study from 2014 showed that approximately 60% of Americans said that their spouse shares the same religion as them – down from 80% decades ago.<sup>1</sup> Today there is evidence to suggest that fewer people are practicing religion in general. In 2014, 23% of Americans indicated not being affiliated with a religion whereas in 2018 the number rose to 26%.<sup>2</sup> This could contribute to the decrease in the number of couples of the same religion, but this brings up a more important question: Does having different religious beliefs make a difference in the quality of relationship? The role religion plays in a relationship varies from couple to couple. For some it might influence their lifestyle or child-rearing practices and for others it might just influence what day they attend services. Regardless of where you land on that spectrum, it is possible to date someone with different beliefs if you follow a few tips.</p>\n<h2><b>Tip 1: Decide if having the same religion is a relationship ‘must have’</b></h2>\n<p>When thinking about your ideal partner, do they have the same religion as you? Is that a non-negotiable for you or is it something that isn’t very important? These are important questions you should take into consideration when deciding whether to date someone. In order to get to know yourself and your desires better, make a list of pros and cons of dating someone with the same religion. What aspects of religion or religious beliefs are especially important to you? Will it be beneficial for your children to learn the same thing from both parents? Will being with someone of the same religion set you in your ways and not allow you to be open to new ways of thinking? If you decide it is something that you do ultimately want in your partner, then seek out dating pools where you have a good chance of finding like-minded people. For people in college, this might include attending the campus faith organization meetings. For others, look to attend church groups or bible studies and be open to meeting people there. There are also dating apps for singles of specific religious affiliations. Any of these avenues can help you meet people if you decide that you want to date within your same religion.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>Tip 2: Be open and communicate about different beliefs</b></h2>\n<p>Having differences does not mean you are incompatible; it just means you need to work to understand the differences and similarities. Being open and trying to understand each other will help a lot in deciding if you are more similar than you are different, because odds are you are similar in at least some areas. Many of the world religions are very similar and revolve around some core ideas such as loving others, treating people kindly, and being generous among many others. However, one difference lies in that Christians and conservative Protestants are less likely to be supportive of interfaith relationships than Evangelicals.<sup>3 </sup>If your partner is of a different faith background, put in effort to learn more about that religion. Not only will this help you understand what your partner believes, it will show your partner that you care about them and want to know them more. However, it is important to note that not everything that the religion teaches is what your partner believes. They might agree or disagree with certain aspects of their religion, and this is where becomes important. Ask your partner what they believe and inform them of what you believe. A longitudinal study of interfaith relationships showed that higher levels of this kind of open communication led to less relationship distress and that having interfaith relationships did not predict higher levels of breakup.<sup>4</sup> Perhaps set up a date for this discussion so that you can both dedicate time and effort to a meaningful conversation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>Tip 3: Make sure you and your partner are on the same page about sex.</b></h2>\n<p>People of different religions have different beliefs about sex and its place before and during marriage. If sex is in important part of a dating relationship for you, then you make sure you communicate that to your potential or current partner so that they can tell you their preferences and stance on the topic. It is important to know that not all people who practice religions are against extramarital sex. Studies show that people who attend church or religious services regularly are less likely to engage in premarital sex. In contrast, people who are practicing but do not attend organized services tend to have more casual sex.<sup>5</sup> For example, practicing Christians who attend religious services might be less open to the idea of having sex in a dating relationship and their religious beliefs might permeate other aspects of the relationship as well such as cohabitation before marriage. There should never be a pressure on you or your partner to do something that is outside of your or their religious beliefs; if sex is something that one of you is not sure about doing, then it might be a good idea to give it more thought before rushing into it. Having a partner who does not practice the same religion as you might make it more difficult for you to stick to what you believe in and abstain from sex &#8211; especially if they see nothing wrong with it and try to convince you of why you should. Ultimately, the partner you are with should want you to do what you feel is best for yourself, especially if that means sticking to your religious beliefs and practicing your faith. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>Tip 4: Do not change just to appease your partner</b></h2>\n<p>After discussing your religion and beliefs with your partner, take note of how receptive and respectful they are of what you have to say. If they say something that puts your beliefs down, then it is time to consider if this is the right relationship for you. Religion often is connected to your family, culture, and identity<sup>6</sup>, so it’s important they respect that part of you. There can be benefits of having a partner of a different faith and your differences should be celebrated because ultimately who wants to marry a clone of themselves?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p>To date, or not to date, the decision is up to you. It is important to remember that just because you and a partner are a different religion does not mean you are more likely to break up. As long as you take the extra steps necessary to know and understand your partner, it is possible to thrive in an interfaith relationship. First, make sure it’s what you want. Next, be open and communicate about what differences you might have. Then, bring up important relationship topics (like sex). Finally, do not change anything about yourself or your partner to make a relationship work. Be intentional about considering these steps, but ultimately, choose a relationship that you know is right for you, and have faith in love.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Murphy, Carlyle.

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>I bet there are certain topics in your relationship that you know will always cause a fight. Maybe it’s money or parenting. Maybe it’s chores or in-laws. The truth is, relationships are filled with communication conflict. Some of it can be anticipated (like with a “hot topic” above), while some of it can feel like it’s coming completely out of the blue.</p>\n<p>Verbal disagreements can occur when we feel attacked, unheard, or misunderstood. More simply, researchers have proposed that communication conflict arises when one partner’s pursuit of his or her goals interferes with the other partner’s goals. These “goals” aren’t necessarily tangible things like “finish the laundry,” they merely refer to desires, wishes, or plans that may or may not be conscious. Let’s use the following example:</p>\n<p>John and Sarah are expecting a baby in the coming months. John was raised Catholic and believes that religion plays a pivotal role in a child’s life. Sarah was raised Unitarian and was not taught to see religion as particularly important to children’s upbringings. Today, John brought up his desire for their baby to be baptized; Sarah scoffed at John’s feelings and immediately dismissed them as ridiculous. “It’s not like the baby will remember one day—who cares?” she mocked. John—feeling attacked—began lashing out at Sarah for her “inability to raise a Christian child” because of her disrespect for him and for Catholicism. They proceeded to fight for the next 30 minutes before both went to separate rooms to cool off.</p>\n<p>According to the goal-oriented view of relationship conflict, we’ll need to look at each partner’s goals to understand what is happening during this fight. John’s goal is to raise his child in a home that teaches and upholds religion—particularly Catholicism. Part of that goal includes having his baby baptized. From this interaction, we can interpret that Sarah’s views of raising her child did not include baptism. But that’s all we know about her goal. Perhaps Sarah is completely aligned with John’s goal up with the exception of the baptism? Or, perhaps they are entirely mis-aligned on their ideas of religion and parenting.</p>\n<p>Because relationships are made up of two individuals with their own individual needs, desires, and goals—conflict is, unfortunately, inevitable. There will always be times where the needs of one compromises the needs of the other. Accepting that fact to be true is an important first step to understanding and getting ahead of relationship conflict or fights…</p>\n<p>By accepting that fights are always going to rear their ugly head in our relationships, we gain a sort of power over them. Let’s go back to Sarah and John. Instead of Sarah making a joke about John’s desire for their baby to be baptized, what might have happened if Sarah asked him why baptism is so important to John? Had she done so, the two could have engaged in meaningful and calm conversation about the importance of religion—with no harsh or disrespectful language. Similarly, had John not immediately attacked Sarah for being unfit to raise a religious child, perhaps he could have calmly asked “what are your views on raising our child Catholic?” By engaging in a discussion, both Sarah and John would have likely left the conversation having a much deeper sense of each other’s goals and feelings surrounding the raising of their child. With both partners’ goals in mind, compromise is a logical next step.</p>\n<h2>How to reduce conflict in your relationship</h2>\n<p>Although we will always have disagreements, we do have a choice about how to navigate them. Sometimes it can feel easier and less vulnerable to simply attack our partner, mock them, or accuse their belief as being wrong. In doing so, we get even farther away from resolving the fight. And the conflict from that fight may even spill into other areas of the relationship.</p>\n<p>For couples who are unhappy in their relationships, it becomes even more important to try to get ahead of conflict, or understand the ways conflict can be reduced—since unhappy couples are 10x more likely than happier couples to use a negative tone of voice during a disagreement, engage in the same patterns each time an argument bubbles to the surface, and remain in conflict for longer periods of time. So, how do you reduce conflict?</p>\n<h3>Makes Conflict Worse – things NOT to do</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the opportunity to bring up other problems in the relationship</li>\n<li>Only blame your partner for the problem</li>\n<li>Listen to your partner just so you can criticize him/her</li>\n<li>Ask hostile and closed-ended questions</li>\n<li>Assume you know what your partner is thinking and feeling about the issue</li>\n<li>Repeat your own positions and opinions</li>\n<li>Follow your partner’s complaint with your own complaint</li>\n<li>Try to prove that your partner is wrong</li>\n<li>Tell your partner what he/she needs to do in order to solve the problem</li>\n<li>Make ultimatums</li>\n<li>Raise issues with a hostile tone</li>\n<li>Reject your partner’s view as wrong</li>\n<li>Interrupt your partner</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reduces or Avoids Conflict – things TO DO</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stay focused on the problem at hand</li>\n<li>Recognize how you are contributing to the conflict</li>\n<li>Listen to your partner with genuine interest; what is he/she saying?</li>\n<li>Ask open-ended questions</li>\n<li>Ask about his/her thoughts and feelings about the issue</li>\n<li>Summarize what your partner says to make sure you understand</li>\n<li>Follow your partner’s complaint with a request for more information</li>\n<li>Work towards agreement/compromise</li>\n<li>Offer constructive suggestions about what you can do to solve the problem</li>\n<li>Remain flexible during the problem-solving phase</li>\n<li>Raise issues in a neutral and gentle way</li>\n<li>Accept your partner’s views as important</li>\n<li>Let your partner finish her/his thoughts</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Our relationships are some of the most challenging and rewarding aspects of life. Finding someone you want to share your life with is a beautiful thing. Falling in love feels magical.</p>\n<p>In fact, falling in love <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/features/health-benefits\">has real health benefits</a> and has an impact on our bodies and our minds. Around <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/669037/share-of-americans-who-believe-in-love/\">87% of Americans</a> believe in true love, which is promising!</p>\n<p>But contrary to popular belief, love is not all you need. Relationships take a lot more than love to keep them going and love alone won&#8217;t keep a couple together.</p>\n<p>Successful relationships take a lot of work to keep both people happy and healthy. Read on for 7 things more important than love that you need to know to make your relationship work.</p>\n<h2>1. Trust</h2>\n<p>One of the most important parts of a relationship is to trust one another completely. You have to be able to trust that they won&#8217;t stray and you trust them with your feelings.</p>\n<p>You have to trust each other enough to be <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/test/\">vulnerable on an emotional</a> and physical level, too. A trusting relationship isn&#8217;t built overnight though, it takes time to grow.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re at the beginning of a relationship and the trust isn&#8217;t all there, give it time to grow. But if you&#8217;re in a long-term relationship and still don&#8217;t trust your partner, it&#8217;s not a good sign.</p>\n<h2>2. Vulnerability</h2>\n<p>Speaking of vulnerability, that&#8217;s the next one on this list. Vulnerability is important in a relationship and it&#8217;s beautiful with the right partner.</p>\n<p>Opening up to your partner without fear of judgment is amazing. They get to know you better and it can strengthen your relationship. If you don&#8217;t allow vulnerability, your relationship will suffer.</p>\n<p>Your partner may feel that you don&#8217;t trust them enough to let them in. They may feel shut out and that can be hurtful if they&#8217;re vulnerable with you.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t bottle it up. Open up and let vulnerability transform your relationship!</p>\n<h2>3. Communication</h2>\n<p>Communication, communication, communication. This is one of the most important aspects of a relationship, but so many couples struggle with it.</p>\n<p>There are many things in a relationship you can solve with effective communication. You need it to set boundaries, to solve problems, express feelings, and more.</p>\n<p>There are some aspects of a relationship that some people can find hard to talk about, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/reigniting-the-fire-how-to-talk-about-sex-with-your-partner/\">like sex for example</a>. But proper communication allows you to identify problems and come up with solutions.</p>\n<h2>4. Honesty</h2>\n<p>In a similar vein to trust, honesty is a huge factor in any relationship. Telling lies or hiding the truth from your partner can destroy your relationship.</p>\n<p>If there isn&#8217;t honesty in a relationship, it&#8217;s pretty much doomed. If there are a lot of little lies or a huge secret in the way, the truth will come out in the end. It will hurt your partner and it could end the relationship.</p>\n<p>Whatever it may be, you have to respect your partner enough to be honest with them. From there, you can work on the relationship, but lies won&#8217;t solve anything.</p>\n<h2>5. Loyalty</h2>\n<p>A huge pillar of a successful relationship is having loyalty to your partner. You need to be loyal to them and only them as your romantic partner. Unless you&#8217;ve both agreed and set boundaries to an open relationship, it&#8217;s non-negotiable.</p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t stay loyal and faithful to your partner, then ask yourself why you&#8217;re with them. Your commitment is paramount and you could cause a lot of pain to them if you&#8217;re unfaithful.</p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t be loyal to your partner, it&#8217;s kinder to end the relationship instead of hurting them further.</p>\n<h2>6. Respect</h2>\n<p>Respect is a huge part of any relationship. You need to have the utmost respect for your partner and yourself.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re in a relationship where you feel put down or degraded, your partner doesn&#8217;t respect you. You also need to respect yourself enough to leave such a situation.</p>\n<p>Both parties need to respect each other&#8217;s feelings and boundaries. You need to value and take care of each other in every way you can.</p>\n<p>When you respect and love one another, you&#8217;ll have a beautiful relationship. This foundation of trust and security is essential and will lead to wonderful things.</p>\n<h2>7. Affection</h2>\n<p>At the start of a relationship, you&#8217;re all loved up and can&#8217;t take your hands off each other. But as time goes on, the affection can dwindle and it&#8217;s important to get it back.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the little things like hand holding or random kisses throughout the day. These little actions show your partner that you love and care about them and it means a great deal.</p>\n<p>Everyone is affectionate in their own way, so take time to learn each others&#8217; love languages. When you find ways to show each other affection, it shows how much you mean to them and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Feeling unappreciated can damage your relationship. Learn how to communicate about bringing affection back and it can make a huge difference.</p>\n<h2>These Are the Keys to Successful Relationships</h2>\n<p>Relationships aren&#8217;t always easy and to keep them going both partners need to work hard. Love is a huge staple of a relationship but it&#8217;s not always enough to keep it strong.</p>\n<p>When you look at all the successful relationships in your life and other couples&#8217;, you&#8217;ll see these 7 things are in each of them. Some of these are harder to work at than others. This is when couples therapy can make a huge difference.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Do external stressors (e.g., finances, family issues, workload, etc.) negatively impact your life and often lead to fights between you and your partner? If so, this post will give you some ideas on how to better cope with stress in order to prevent fights.</p>\n<p>Many couples deal with external stress. While some stress is unavoidable, how we cope with it is often what leads to more problems in our relationships. Here are a few cycles that develop around this problem area: <strong>&#8220;This stress is killing me and my partner doesn’t get it&#8221;</strong> and <strong>&#8220;We are up to our ears in stress&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>One of you is experiencing external stress and may not know how to handle it. As a result, the stressed partner may pull away from the relationship or take it out on the other partner. The other partner may feel hurt that the partner is pulling away or feel like they need to walk on eggshells to avoid more fights.</p>\n<h2>I’m Buried in Stress</h2>\n<p>Stress can turn your partner from your biggest support system to your enemy. Instead of letting your stress drive a wedge in your relationship, consider the following tips.Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h3><strong>1. STOP, DROP, &#8230;</strong></h3>\n<p>Your partner only wants what is best for you. Try to notice when your stress is higher and STOP for a few moments before you accidentally take it out on your partner by snapping, yelling, or pulling away. Tell your partner you need 5 minutes, and use that time to yourself to de-stress and DROP your old habits.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. &#8230;and ENROLL</strong></h3>\n<p>Instead, you can use your partner as an ally against the stress. You may consider sharing with your partner what’s causing the stress (remember your DEEP Understanding and Speaker/Listener tips). If talking about it is too hard, tell your partner you are feeling stressed but that you want to spend time with him/her, even if you do not talk about the stressor. Consider taking a walk, watching your favorite TV show, playing a game, or something else that will allow you to spend time together.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. TELL YOUR PARTNER</strong></h3>\n<p>Sometimes it’s not possible to get your partner’s help in solving the stressor or to help you relax. If so, at least TELL your partner you’re feeling really stressed right now. When your partner knows that you’re stressed, he/she is less likely to take your behavior personally. You partner might even help out in extra ways if he/she knows you’re stressed.</p>\n<h2>Can’t My Partner Check their Stress at the Door?</h2>\n<p>The more your partner is stressed, the more he/she may take it out on you. While it may be hard to see your partner so stressed, you likely feel frustrated that it leads to him/her withdrawing from you or lashing out. You probably want to support your partner, but maybe you don’t know how to do it, or maybe your attempts at helping only seem to make things work. So what do you do when you feel so stuck? Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h3><strong>1. STAY UNITED</strong></h3>\n<p>Your best defense against your partner’s stress is handling the situation as a team. If this is your core issue, use the Respond conversation to decide with your partner what the expectations are for how you can stay united, despite the stressor. Once the two of you are on the same page, do your part to make the changes you agreed upon. When talking about your stress, continue to remind each other that regardless of what is going on, your relationship is a priority and that you can work through the stressful times together.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. PROVIDE SUPPORT</strong></h3>\n<p>You may not know the best way to provide support to your partner. Therefore, use the Respond conversation to ask your partner what is the best way to support him/her without making things worse. If your partner doesn’t know, consider using a Problem-Solving conversation activity in the 4th phase of the program to work together to identify the best method. Sometimes, talking about the problem is not helpful in the moment, so consider how else you may provide support like washing the dishes or something else off the to-do list (so your partner has less to worry about).</p>\n<p>In this cycle, both partners are under great amounts of stress and it negatively impacts the relationship. You both may pull away from each other in response to the stress or it may cause you to take your frustrations out on each other.</p>\n<h2>Stress Buries us Both</h2>\n<p>As you saw in the External Stress activity, when we’re stressed, we tend to communicate less effectively and assume the worst about our partners. Needless to say, that’s not good for relationships! You both may be so overwhelmed by stress that it is easier in the moment to take it out on each other or pull away &#8211; but this probably leaves both of you feeling hopeless and unsupported. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h3><strong>1. STAY UNITED</strong></h3>\n<p>Your best defense against stress is handling the situation as a team. Once the two of you are on the same page, do your part to make the changes you agreed upon.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. TELL YOUR PARTNER</strong></h3>\n<p>Sometimes it’s not possible to get your partner’s help in solving the stressor or to help you relax. Sometimes, you just need to get away from it all – and that includes your partner. If so, at least TELL your partner you’re feeling really stressed right now. When your partner knows that you’re stressed, he/she is less likely to take your behavior personally. You partner might even help out in extra ways if he/she knows you’re stressed.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. MAKE A PLAN AHEAD OF TIME</strong></h3>\n<p>When you’re feeling really stressed isn’t the best time to figure out how to deal with that stress. Instead, make a plan with your partner that you can put into action when you’re stressed. The plan should include: a) How will you let your partner know that you’re stressed?; b) What are you going to do in those situations (and for how long)?; and c) What should your partner do? And don’t forget to also make a plan for when your partner is stressed – you might be surprised at the differences!</p>\n<h3><strong>4. STAY ACTIVE OR DO SOMETHING FUN</strong></h3>\n<p>When the weight of stress becomes the focus of a relationship, other things often fall to the back burner. Even if you have no control over a stressor, you do have a control over your relationship and how you can stay connected. Try to prioritize some fun activities you can do together or doing something active like going on a walk at a local park. The stressor will not go away, but you will feel united and closer as a couple, which will make handling the stressor the next time much easier since you will feel more like a team.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By: Samantha Salvi Cruz</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Finding out that your spouse has cancer can be extremely devastating and distressing. One of your initial thoughts might be “How do I support someone through this?” <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> During cancer treatment, support is integral to not only the patient, but to you as their caregiver. Social support has been found to have positive effects on treatment by reducing stress and improving emotional well-being.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>8</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Married female cancer patients report partner support as vital and has been associated with greater quality of life and lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> On the other hand, unsupportive behaviors, such as less empathy and affection, may lead to reduction in the patient’s ability to cope.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">, While it may be overwhelming as a caregiver due to the increase in responsibility, you can make a tremendous impact on your partner’s experience and possible road to recovery. Below are four tips on how to best support your partner through their cancer experience, while coping with the process yourself.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Talk to your partner about their cancer diagnosis and foster open communication with them about their emotional experiences.</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> From the onset of your partner’s diagnosis, you should communicate openly with them. Because cancer negatively affects the quality of both of your lives, you should face it together. Believe it or not, you both may be experiencing many of the same concerns and emotions, as chronic diseases often cause a detrimental impact on mental health in both the patients and spouses.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>6</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> For your spouse, it is reassuring and comforting to know that they will have robust support from a loved one throughout their diagnosis, treatment, and recovery stages.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Do not be afraid to disclose that you are feeling scared. Be honest, open, and willing to engage in discussions with your partner, as both of you are coping with major stressors. If conversations about your partner’s cancer diagnosis and challenges are avoided, it may lead to the perception from your partner that you are not supportive.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> As a caregiver, you might use this technique of avoidance as self-protection; however, this can increase your partner’s distress and intrusive thoughts about cancer.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Couples have reported that having supportive conversations about cancer positively influences their quality of life and has been perceived as being helpful.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> At the same time, negative communication, such as criticism, unhealthy disagreement, and discussing conflict topics, can be damaging to adaptive coping mechanisms.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>2 </sup></span><span class=\"s1\">Therefore, have discussions where you disclose specific emotional aspects of your experiences, possible approaches to their diagnosis and treatment, coping strategies, finances, household duties and roles, or simply ask them how you can help. Talk about the cancer, as it is related to post traumatic growth and increased appreciation of your loved ones.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> All in all, the more you support one another and engage in healthy discussions, the better your partner’s interpretation of their stressful cancer experience will be. There will be times you need to take on the role as listener and give them the space that they need to react and reflect.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>In daily activities, invisibly support your partner.</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> To gain a sense of connectedness with your partner in your day-to-day lives, you should support your partner on a daily basis. Invisible support is social support that is not visible to your partner; therefore, it goes unnoticed. An example of unobserved support is when you’ve completed household chores and do not mention it to your partner. Invisible support is an important aspect of alleviating stress from the patient, especially when completing daily tasks. Invisible support positively affects your partner’s outlook on challenging circumstances by making them seem less overwhelming.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> This kind of support is especially helpful to your partner, because it doesn’t reduce their feelings of self-efficacy.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>7</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> When your daily efforts to support your partner are made obvious to them, your partner may feel like they are incapable of accomplishing those goals on their own. However, when partners are invisibly supported in everyday life, it helps maintain intimacy, psychosocial adaptation, and is linked to a positive evaluation of the relationship, which, in turn, can alleviate distress.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>7</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> With that being said, help your partner with duties that will lessen their load without being told to do so, as it will make them feel less overwhelmed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Talk about sex and intimacy with your partner and challenge your preexisting perceptions.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> </b>Sexuality and intimacy in a relationship are directly correlated with quality of life and well-being.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Your partner’s cancer and treatments may pose a limitation to sexual desires and feelings of attractiveness. Therefore, it is important to foster open communication with one another about intimacy, possible limitations caused by cancer, and general feelings about sex. Acknowledge the issues that may be caused by your preexisting perceptions of frailty, chemotherapy, or even depression on libido.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> With cancer, couples usually perceive patients as “fragile,” thus, reducing their sexual desires and needs, which has a significant negative effect on their sexual relationship.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Sexual intimacy becomes less of a priority because of these associations. Do not think of sex as “frivolous activity,” as it may lead to you feeling guilty about your own wants.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Challenge those thoughts that you and your partner might have by recognizing and communicating those feelings.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Be aware of the possible limitations that cancer may pose, such as decreased libido</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>9</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">, and have a conversation with your partner and a healthcare professional about intimacy, sex, and alternative modes of sexual behavior. Some true limits need to be negotiated in these discussions, as cancer treatment can hinder sexual performance. If you cannot express your love for each other physically, demonstrate it on an emotional level. Most importantly, remind your partner that their recovery is the number one priority.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>To support your partner through cancer, you must take care of yourself first.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> This tip revolves around the idea that you cannot pour from an empty cup. Self-care is crucial for your mental and physical health. It serves as a method to prevent stress from escalating and to cope with it as it arises. Take time to enjoy life and know that it is okay to engage in activities that interest you. Exercise and be physically active to promote endorphins and prevent anxiety symptoms.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Find a supportive, loving, and trustworthy social network of friends, family members, and community resources. This support system can prevent depression and alleviate emotional distress in the initial months of your partner’s cancer.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> If your own needs are not met, it can lead to emotional vulnerability and conflict can follow, which can be detrimental to your relationship and partner’s coping strategies.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Additionally, find a list of resources and accurate information about cancer care. Obtaining correct information about cancer treatment can help you both in your decision-making process, preparation for treatment, and coping with the adverse effects of the medications.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>10</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> These are all measures that you can take to improve your psychological well-being and health during this difficult time.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Conclusion</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b> </b><span class=\"s1\">By facilitating open discussions with your partner about their experiences, emotions, and needs, and helping them with daily tasks leads to an improved quality of life for you and your partner. And know that everything doesn’t have to be about cancer. Go on dates at home, watch movies together, cook together, make time for each other as a couple. It is an overwhelming role to take on, but it is one that can be handled.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> <b>References</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>6</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">Baider, L., Perez, T., &amp; Kaplan De-Nour, A.

Being the non-socially anxious partner can be demanding and your partner’s behaviors may negatively affect the quality of your relationship and easily upset you. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Learning about social anxiety in relationships and how your socially anxious partner is likely to respond to situations can guide you to the best way to communicating with and understanding your partner’s feelings and behaviors. About 7% or 15 million U.S. adults have a diagnosed social anxiety disorder. </span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Social anxiety is associated with interpersonal difficulties which means that an individual with this diagnosis feels anxious in social interactions due to the fear of being negatively evaluated and rejected.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>2</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> As a way of responding to a perceived danger or threat of feeling rejected, socially anxious individuals withdraw easily from social gatherings or avoid social contact completely.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3 </sup></span><span class=\"s1\">Socially anxious individuals are less likely to get married or be in a romantic relationship.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4 </sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite this, it is clear that some people with social anxiety do seek out, desire and get involved in intimate relationships. As the non-socially anxious partner you may fail to recognize that some of the problematic ways your partner communicates with you in your relationship may be due to their social anxiety and is simply their way of taking precautions and managing risk regulation. Below we will examine what some of the difficulties are that socially anxious individuals express in romantic relationships and what you can do about them.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Expression of negative emotions<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It should be of no surprise that intimacy is important in a romantic relationship. Being able to open up about negative emotions and address both relationship and personal problems to your partner can be a key factor in developing intimacy and closeness in a relationship.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5 </sup></span><span class=\"s1\">Like mentioned earlier, socially anxious individuals fear rejection and negative evaluation.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>2</sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">People with greater social anxiety are likely to self-disclosure less in a relationship due to the risk of potentially getting hurt.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>6</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> They are also more likely to avoid the expression of negative information in an effort to protect themselves and avoid relationship problems.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5 </sup></span><span class=\"s1\">This may be bothersome to you because you want to show your partner that they can come to you for anything and that they should feel safe to express their negative emotions. Surprisingly, allowing your socially anxious partner to withhold negative emotions can actually be beneficial to your relationship.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Because of the extreme of self-doubt and social fear that socially anxious people experience, encouraging them to express their negative emotions can resolve in greater avoidance, more complaining, and more need for reassurance. These factors can spark increased distress and negative behavior in the non-anxious partner. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Eventually, this causes disconnection and decrease in relationship satisfaction.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span> <span class=\"s3\">On the other hand, less negative emotional expression can enhance closeness in a relationship.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5 </sup></span><span class=\"s1\">Give your partner time and space; do not force your partner to discuss their feelings before than they are willing. With time, they will feel more comfortable with you and will eventually open more up about their negative emotions. Due to their social anxiety, it may take more time than for others.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Failure to recognize capitalization support</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Any partner’s ability to positively respond to the good news of their significant other to amplify their happiness can be a key determining factor of well-being and satisfaction in a relationship.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> If you are in a relationship with a socially anxious person, you may feel like you are not receiving enough support or enthusiastic responses from your partner when you experience positive events and share with them good news. Also, you may feel like your partner’s appreciation of your efforts of providing them support is low.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This can lead to significant relationship dissatisfaction. It is likely that you feel like your socially anxious partner’s non-supportive behaviors are due to jealousy or a problem they have with you, but in fact this may be the result of their social anxiety.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Individuals high in social anxiety are more likely to fail to recognize when and how to give proper supportive responses. They may also have problems processing enthusiastic support received from their partner.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3 </sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Now that you know that your partner’s behavior is not because of their problem with you, you can approach the situation differently. Instead of being angry or upset, start by helping your partner recognize the positive situations. Make a list that contains both positive and negative situations. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Then, sit down with your partner and walk them through the situations and ask them how they would react to each situation: happy, sad, angry, or no reaction. This gives you an overview of the situations your partner is failing to recognize. From there, you can help your partner read the social cues better and help them reactions that may be better fit the situation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>However, we don’t expect you to become your partner’s therapist!</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Using depreciation as a self-defensive mechanism</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another feature of socially anxious behavior in a romantic relationship is a tendency to put-down their partner as a self-defensive mechanism. Socially anxious individuals are more likely to perceive any little negative interaction in a relationship as a potential risk of rejection. When they feel like a threat of rejection is present, they often protect themselves by devaluing their partner.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>6</sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Examples of devaluing could be suddenly treating their partner with less respect, being angry or pretending not to care about them or the relationship. These actions can be very hurtful for you and may push you away. You should try your best to remain physically and mentally present and not let it bother you. It will show your partner that you want to stay in the relationship and that whatever negative interaction you had does not define the relationship and your feelings about them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Conclusion</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now you have read about some of the problems that an individual with social anxiety could face in a romantic relationship. This information should give you a better understanding of the nature of some relationship problems you might have that may be overwhelming and causing you distress or frustration. Understanding that these behaviors are normal for socially anxious individuals and not purposely done by your partner to upset you is an important reminder. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Maintaining a romantic relationship with an individual with mental health problems will often be more demanding, you may have to be more aware of your actions and understanding of the range of difficulties your partner has to deal with. To enhance relationship satisfaction, encourage your partner to seek out professional therapy to help them learn the best techniques to minimize and deal with their social anxiety. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, as we’ve discussed, you also have a lot of control over your relationship with your partner even if they don’t seek therapy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>As best you can, try to be patient and careful in communication when expressing negative emotions. Also, remember to show your partner that you’re in this together – and that you’ll be there for them. </span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3,5,6</sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">Social anxiety disorder.

      "rendered": "<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>By: Easton Thomas</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Times are changing, especially when it comes to attitudes about living with a romantic partner. Cohabitation (defined as living with a romantic or sexual partner without being married) has become more popular, with 59% of American adults having lived with a partner before marriage</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. There is research showing cohabitation leads to more problems with marriage, including divorce</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>2</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. While these studies are scary for those looking to move in with their partner, the research also shows that there are factors that put some couples at more risk than others. Moving in together is a big decision and having a conversation about it is important. </span><span class=\"s3\">This post will focus on how you and your partner can navigate such a complex decision and what the relationship looks like moving forward.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">Questions to Ask Yourself and Your Partner</span><span class=\"s1\">:</span></h2>\n<h3><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Would this be the first time you or your partner have lived with a romantic partner?</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Living with a partner is an exciting step in a relationship and may be uncharted territory for some. While having experience living with a partner may bring comfort, those who have lived with a romantic partner prior to living with their spouse are more likely to have their marriage end in divorce</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. While the reason is unclear, research shows the higher the number of partners a person has lived with, the higher the chances of getting a divorce</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. If this is your (and your partner’s) first time living with a romantic partner, your chances of a successful relationship are better than if it’s your second or third partner</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Are you in a “stay-over” relationship?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">A stay-over relationship is a relationship where one person spends several nights a week at their partner’s place</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. These relationships are fun and a great way to spend time together while maintaining your own space. However, keep in mind that stay-over relationships can cause issues if there is confusion on what the next steps are</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Having a conversation about the long-term living situation can be a way to clear up that confusion. When couples decide to move in together, it can add a sense of certainty that may not have been there before</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Couples who are happy with a stay-over relationship and have discussed the future of the relationship are fine if they continue to communicate about expectations for the future. Some couples may find the decision to live together comforting as a confirmation of the relationship status and future</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Are you “deciding” to live together instead of “sliding”?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">The idea of “sliding” has to do with a slow increase in commitment to the relationship</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. It often goes unnoticed and feels like a pressure to move on to the next step</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Clothes in a drawer turn into a shared closet and before they know it the realization sets in that a couple is living together</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>6</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. While many may experience this slow transition into cohabitation, making the decision together ensures everyone is on the same page about the relationship</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. When “deciding” to move in together, both partners are aware of what to expect and can plan for different relationship outcomes</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Sometimes sliding into a relationship can lead to one or both partners feeling trapped and unable to leave the relationship</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>7</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Keep this in mind when considering the next question.</span></p>\n<h3><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>If you are planning on sharing resources, can these resources be separated in the event the relationship ends?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Sharing resources goes together with “sliding” into a relationship</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. As a couple goes from having a drawer at the other’s home to sharing the entire living space, it is easy to see how it can be difficult to determine what belongs to whom</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. An example of this is getting a pet or having a baby together. An unhappy couple may stay together solely for the pet or child</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>7</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. If the relationship ends, the difficult decision of who keeps the pet or who has custody of the child must be made. To add another layer of complexity, financial dependence on a partner makes it harder for the couple to break up if they are unhappy</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>8</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. While uncomfortable to think about, discussing how to split resources if the relationship does end is an important part of planning to move in together.</span></p>\n<h3><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Do you and your partner have the same long-term/marriage goals?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">For many couples, marriage is an important step of a relationship and the ultimate goal</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>2</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. While some may see living together as a step towards marriage, not everyone has the same set of beliefs</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>2</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Therefore, having a discussion of both partner’s goals in the relationship is crucial. For couples living together, those that do see marriage as an important step tend to be happier than the ones that don’t care about marriage or try to delay it</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>9</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Couples who are engaged when they move in together also tend to be happier and are less likely to divorce</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>8</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Additionally, most couples who are not engaged when living together tend to feel uncertain about at least one aspect of the relationship, particularly whether the relationship will last</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>10</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Couples should discuss their beliefs on marriage and long-term relationship goals before deciding whether to make a commitment about moving in together.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Are you moving in for reasons other than testing the relationship?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Partner compatibility is the third most common concern in relationships, which explains why many couples live together just to test the relationship</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>10</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Testing a relationship is when a couple hopes that moving in together will provide clarity on whether marriage is a good idea and whether it will solve existing problems</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>11</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. These couples are less confident and have less commitment to their partner</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>11</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. In comparison, couples with fewer problems while dating are more likely to marry; this is likely due to the increased confidence from not having the need to test the relationship through cohabiting</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>11</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Testing the relationship is a problem not only because the relationship is more likely to end, but because moving in together adds constraints that make it difficult to leave the relationship (as discussed in questions 3 and 4)</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. To summarize: don’t move in to test the relationship.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s5\">Conclusion</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Moving in together is an extremely personal decision between you and your partner where there is no right or wrong answer. Hopefully, by raising these questions, you and your partner will be able assess the state of the relationship and the ultimate goals you each seek. Having this assessment will allow you to make informed decisions on the future course you wish the relationship to take. Remember to consider your own well-being as an individual when asking these questions as they serve not only to improve upon great relationships, but also prevent from getting into or staying in those which are unhealthy. If the relationship is not going well or if there are questions about the next steps, moving in together probably won’t make things better. In the end, do what you think is best for your overall happiness.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s5\"><b>What’s your risk score?</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If you answered </span><span class=\"s5\"><b>yes</b></span><span class=\"s1\"> to:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li8\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>5-6 Questions = Low Risk<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li8\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Give it a shot! </b>Moving in may be a good thing for the relationship. Remember to keep having regular check-ins with yourself and your partner.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li9\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>3-4 Questions = Medium Risk<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li9\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Sleep on it. </b>Moving in may or may not be the right next step at this moment. You might have a few more steps to take before you and your partner are ready, but keep giving the decision and relationship some thought.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li10\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>0-2 Questions = High Risk</b></span>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li10\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Hold your horses. </b>Moving in can wait. You and your partner may need to have a few conversations before the decision of living together is on the table. You might want to reevaluate the relationship all together and whether it is a relationship you want to continue.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">References</span></p>\n<p class=\"p11\"><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Graf, N.

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p><strong>By Salena Fortich</strong></p>\n<p>Increasingly, couples have to deal with some sort of long-distance arrangement at some point during the relationship. It is estimated that 3 million Americans live apart from their spouses for reasons unrelated to conflict or separation.</p>\n<p>The number of long-distance relationships is even higher amongst younger couples. Up to 75% of college students have been in a long-distance relationship at some point. Long distance relationships have the potential to generate downstream psychological effects related to physical separation such as concerns regarding loyalty, fidelity, and commitment to the relationship.</p>\n<p>A key to maintaining a healthy and positive relationship is focusing on staying connected and intimate! Below are a few tips to help you navigate your long-distance relationship:</p>\n<h2><strong>Have a Routine of Daily Communication</strong></h2>\n<p>It isn’t a surprise that the greater distance and time between visits puts additional strains on relationships and leads to poorer relationship outcomes. However, technological advancement in the past few decades has increased mutual and immediate availability in communication in long-distance relationships.</p>\n<p>Although you may not be able to see your partner every day, there is a sense of security made possible by daily communication. Phones and computers allow partners to communicate across long distances and share many experiences to help mitigate the effect of physical distance.<sup>3 </sup>So, how does one develop a daily routine of communication?</p>\n<p>It is important to understand that intimacy in relationships is much more than sexual intimacy. Emotional intimacy is a key factor in maintaining positive long-distance relationships.<sup>4 </sup>Emotional intimacy is especially important in long-distance relationships where physical contact is limited.</p>\n<p>Couples in long-distance relationships should fill their time with texts or verbal conversations when they communicate with each other. It is important to talk about your everyday lives and to explore each other’s separate lives to help develop emotional intimacy.</p>\n<p>Making plans helps romantic partners to decrease the effects of uncertainty by creating structure and routines! Many couples engage in planning talk to help produce certainty about future face-to-face interactions.<sup>4</sup> These conversations can consist of making actual plans for when you’ll see each other again. For example, you and your partner can develop a plan for a date night out or an activity to have something to look forward to the next time you are with one another.</p>\n<p>When couples are apart, it is important to plan on having serious talks face-to-face via Facetime or other forms of video chats. Face-to-face communication – even when you’re not in the same room &#8211; allows for the most immediate and honest context. It also allows partners to feel more confident that they can understand one another when they are able to see facial expressions and body language.</p>\n<p>It is important to have a routine when it comes to talking on the phone or video chat but also make sure it doesn’t begin to feel like a chore. Sometimes over-communicating, either over the phone or through text, can become overbearing; therefore, it is important to find a happy medium that works for both partners schedules when they are away from each other.</p>\n<h2><strong>Set Clear Rules and Boundaries</strong></h2>\n<p>In any relationship, but especially those that are in long distance, setting boundaries is a key component to a healthy relationship. Boundaries allow you to establish expectations of what both you and your partner want in the relationship.</p>\n<p>It allows you both to explicitly state what you are and are not comfortable with in terms of both you and your partner’s actions.</p>\n<p>First, it is important to discuss the status of your relationship. Before physically separating and going long distances, it is important to make it clear what both partners expect out of the relationship. Confusion can come when you think you are in an exclusive relationship – but your partner doesn’t – when you two are apart.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether it’s a non-monogamous or monogamous relationship, it is important to establish both of your sexual expectations. By clarifying the nature of your relationship and holding the space to discuss this, you are allowing for a safe and intimate space.</p>\n<p>This is important to foster safety, commitment, and respect within your relationship.<br />\nIn setting rules and boundaries, you must make sure you trust one another and are open with communication.6 Social media is a great tool to stay in contact and get to understand your partner’s life away from you. But it also can be difficult to navigate at times.</p>\n<p>With the increased usage of social media and constantly posting, a common issue that arises in long-distance relationships is jealousy or insecurity. If you see a post or comment that may have made you question your relationship or feel yourself questioning it, it is important to speak up. It is easy when you are long-distance to let little things boil up. But it is important to communicate when certain actions bother you to avoid a snowballing effect.</p>\n<h2><strong>Do things together when you’re apart!</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges that come with long-distance relationships is the inability to share experiences together. While it is hard to be able to go on dates to a museum or to go to a stadium and watch a game, there are ways to try and maintain the novelty of dating. In today’s world, technology has greatly advanced the ways couples can interact even when they may be a couple of hundred miles away.</p>\n<p>Facetime and video chat help keep the face-to-face interaction and allows for planned virtual dates. Although you may not be able to physically go to a restaurant together, a great alternative is to share dinners over video chat.</p>\n<p>By pre-planning these virtual dinner dates, couples can see each other and get a sense of being together.</p>\n<p>Creating a sense of being together is important since this idea of shared living over video chat allows for couples to see each other’s reactions and get a better sense of how each person is doing. Doing so allows a dimension of empathy that cannot be received simply through text messages or even simple phone calls.</p>\n<p>Another idea of what to do together when you are apart is to plan to watch a show together. If a show plays live on TV every Monday, couples can plan to video chat and watch it together. This too, like the dinner dates, allows for each partner to feel more connected and get to experience the moment together. It is important to provide a sense of shared experiences with each other because it allows for growth in your relationship.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>Staying Intimate and Connected in Long Distance<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></h2>\n<p>If you find yourself in a long-distance relationship and are struggling, just remember you are not alone. Remember, it is okay to feel uncomfortable and uncertain when in a long-distance relationship. It is also normal to feel that your intimacy is dwindling when you are not geographically close. However, if you can have a routine and communicate daily, establish boundaries, and incorporate activities to share even when apart, your relationship will continue to progress in a healthy direction. These three tips alone will continue to grow and help maintain that intimacy in your relationship even when you are hundreds of miles away.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Learn More about How to Improve Your Relationship!</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\"><b>www.ourrelationship.com</b></a></p>\n",

Many couples view cohabitation as a stepping stone to marriage; however, the likelihood of cohabiters transitioning to marriage is dependent upon education levels.</span>(Those more highly educated are more likely to get married after living together than are people with a lower level of education<sup>3</sup>.) <span class=\"s1\">Moving in together presents its own set of unique challenges from splitting chores, to divvying up rent, to figuring out how much time to spend together.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Additionally, couples living together report more physical aggression, increased frequency of sex, more negative communication, higher levels of commitment, and decreased relationship satisfaction when compared to couples that are just dating</span><span class=\"s1\">. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It may be tempting to move in together out of convenience or because you want to spend more time together; however, when couples move in together to test the relationship, it becomes problematic</span><span class=\"s1\">. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Regardless of all the external factors, it’s important to make a conscious decision that moving in together is the right next step for your relationship. If not, it may not be all rainbows and butterflies like you had hoped. However, this does not mean that your relationship is doomed just because you decided to live together. Below are some tips to consider:</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Determine whether you decided or slid into moving in together</b>. </span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There can be all kinds of reasons to move in together — your lease is up, you spend so much time at your partner’s place anyway, you’ll both save money, your roommate just moved out. The issue is that, instead of making a conscious decision about living together, many couples just let it happen &#8211; which is called sliding. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the other hand, deciding is making an informed decision to live with your significant other after having a conversation about the goals and the reasons for cohabiting. After you have moved in together, there may be plenty of reasons that make it harder to break up—what researchers call constraints.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When people slide into relationship transitions, they may start building constraints before they have a chance to think about whether they want to be committed or dedicated to this person and this relationship</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Since you are already living with your partner, just take the time to sit down together and ensure that you are on the same page as to what your long-term relationship goals are. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Moving forward, it is also better to avoid taking on things together that might make it harder to end a relationship (even if you are no longer wanting to stay in the relationship) such as a dog, a joint bank account, or a child. By not having any constraints, you are able to cut ties if it does not work out without feeling like you are in too deep or stuck.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span><span class=\"s1\"><b>Take time-outs to improve negative communication</b>. </span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As I mentioned earlier, negative communication often increases once couples move in together. So, when you are trying to communicate with your partner and it seems to be going awry (specifically if you are getting heated or frustrated with each other), take a time-out instead of continuing to go around in circles without being productive</span><span class=\"s1\">. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The period for a time-out can range from 20 minutes to 24 hours, but not more than that so that it does not seem like you are trying to avoid talking with your partner. During the time-out, do not keep the fight alive in your head by ruminating over it. Instead, watch your favorite show, read that book that has been sitting on your shelf for months, take a nap, meditate, or take a soothing bath. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After the time-out is over, talk things through with your partner in a calm manner, repair any damage that was sustained, and apologize for any hurtful things that may have been said or done. By taking time to regroup and think rationally, both of you will be more willing to understand the point of view of the other person which decreases the likelihood of yelling and insulting each other. If there is less negative communication, then you will have a more productive discussion and a more positive experience.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Engage in novel activities together. </b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even though moving in together with your other (and perhaps better) half means you get to spend more time together, how that time is spent is crucial. According to studies, when couples just Netflix and chill or go to dinner at the same restaurant, or fall into other routines, relationship satisfaction decreases</span><span class=\"s1\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s4\">To avoid</span><span class=\"s1\"> falling into the same rut, share new experiences together by engaging in novel activities such as dancing, a weekend getaway, getting a scuba certification, or cooking a different cuisine together</span><span class=\"s1\">. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You could even take this a step further by trying out an unfamiliar activity in bed which can range from acting out a sexual fantasy to trying a new position or using a toy. By enjoying exciting and arousing endeavors together, you will feel closer to each other, which leads to higher levels of relationship satisfaction.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While moving in together poses its own set of challenges, it is also a unique opportunity to truly get to know and have fun with your partner. Living together is also a great chance to get to know yourself and your own triggers. As you are testing out the waters for yourself, the tips mentioned in the blog post are the top three things you can do to reduce the adverse effects that moving in together before getting engaged seems to have. Which of these tips stuck out the most to you? Which one are you most excited to implement with your partner? By giving any of the tips a try, moving in with the love of your life might just be the best decision you have ever made.</span></p>\n<p>Learn more about the OurRelationship program today:</p>\n<div class=\"vid_frame\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GIHQkpf0bs\"><p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\">OurRelationship®</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;OurRelationship®&#8221; &#8212; OurRelationship\" src=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/embed/#?secret=GIHQkpf0bs\" data-secret=\"GIHQkpf0bs\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n",

Try things you’ve never done before &#8211; if you don’t like it, encourage your partner to change what they&#8217;re doing.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">Step 5</span><span class=\"s1\">: Sensual intercourse</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Finally, you and your partner can engage in intercourse.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The goal of this step is NOT to have an orgasm (although it’s totally okay if you do!!), but rather, the goal is to feel connected to your partner and find what feels good for you.</span></p>\n<h2><i></i><span class=\"s1\">Practice mindfulness on your own and/or during sexual interactions</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Practicing mindfulness alone has been found to reduce shame and increase acceptance of traumatic events.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Here’s how to get started:</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Take a seat &#8211; If you are sitting in a chair put both feet on the floor and rest your hands on your lap.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>If you are sitting on the floor, find a comfortable position</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Set a time limit &#8211; Start with just 5 minutes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You can always build this up, but do not force yourself to engage in this for too long the first time.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Notice the different sensations in your body &#8211; Are your shoulders by your ears? Are you clenching your jaw?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Try to notice any areas of tension and give yourself permission to relax them even if it’s just for the 5 minutes of mindfulness.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Feel and focus on your breath &#8211; Imagine you’re sending your breath into different areas of your body.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It may be helpful to inhale for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, and repeat.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Notice when your mind wanders &#8211; The whole point of mindfulness is to let your mind wander, and you simply observe the thoughts.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Imagine a stream of water where your thoughts are leaves floating down the stream.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Some move faster than others; nonetheless, just let the thoughts float by without judging them</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kindly invite your mind back to your breath &#8211; When your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breath.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Speak to yourself the way you would someone you love and bring your attention back to your inhales and exhales.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Using mindfulness while you are having sex can help you stay present in the moment and actually leads to a more enjoyable sex life (with more orgasms!!) and subsequently, higher relationship satisfaction.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>11</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> The key is to focus your attention on whatever is bringing you pleasure.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Here are some ideas to get you started:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">The feeling of your partner’s fingertips on your skin</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Your partner’s breathing pattern &#8211; you may even match their breathing</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Focus on what you see, hear, taste, smell, and feel.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Engage all your senses</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Are you ready to involve your partner by practicing sensate focus or discussing sexual likes and dislikes? Or would you rather take an independent approach and try mindfulness for a couple minutes?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>These options can be a great way to start cultivating a more positive relationship with yourself, your partner, and sex.</span></p>\n",

Whether it is with your children, friends, or partner, vulnerability helps us get to know the people in our lives and really connect to them. There are many hurdles we must face to becoming emotionally intimate—whether its building trust, becoming self-aware, or having difficult self-reflection or conversations. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">However, without vulnerability, we would not reach intimacy &#8211; and this would lead to relationships that feel superficial and dry. With intimacy comes conversations, love, understanding, a better sex life, and many more emotions that build in an intimate relationship.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you feel like your relationship lacks depth and real conversation? Are you trying to find a way to be emotionally vulnerable with your partner and open up in a way you did not before? Did you know that, simply by communicating positively with your partner, your relationship is more likely to feel fulfilled by both you and your significant other?</span><span class=\"s1\"> Here are some tips to help be emotionally vulnerable in your relationship.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>To improve conflict resolution, be mindful and accepting of your partner’s feelings.</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Healthy expression of one’s own emotions includes both positive and negative feelings during a discussion.</span><span class=\"s1\"> This contributes to better self-acceptance, personal growth, and interpersonal intimacy.</span><span class=\"s1\"> In a discussion, you can attempt to be aware of your partners’ feelings and seek to maintain a safe environment. An example of this could be when you notice your partner is upset; you can tell them &#8220;Even though we are arguing, I still love you” or try to crack a joke about the situation to ease some tension. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If your partner feels threatened or anxious, be aware that they can begin to place or take the blame &#8211; causing them to revert to past responses which tend to not be useful in conflict resolution. By observing your significant other’s emotions, you can notice that your partner is becoming detached. Your partner can become quiet, not wanting to talk, walk out in the middle of a discussion, and find other ways to isolate themselves. Be empathetic about your partner&#8217;s feelings without judging or pushing them away. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Your partner may feel one way, but they’re suppressing how they feel or becoming emotionally distant.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>However, if you become distant, they are even more likely to pull away. This prevents conflict resolution and increases the likelihood that the argument will arise again.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>In a heterosexual relationship, men are least likely to be emotionally vulnerable. Men are taught to mistrust strong emotions, such as crying because they are seen as a weakness.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Thus, you should be vigilant about how your partner feels. You can offer new ways to respond in your relationship if you are aware your significant other tends to mask emotional vulnerability to improve conflict resolution. If you notice your partner is upset, ask them “tell me how you feel”, or you can suggest: “do you want to talk about it?” to ease into a difficult or stressful conversation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> If you notice the argument seems to be escalating and hurtful words could be said, say “I think we should relax and discuss this later when we aren’t as upset”. This gives your partner time to relax and not act out in anger.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It also gives them time to think through the argument, and what to say with a calm and collected mind.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Speaking in a calm moment rather than in anger improves conflict resolution and overall discussions. In an intense dispute, the person with less power may respond in reactive ways to appear powerful to mask their sense of vulnerability.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Try to remember your partner may need a moment to relax or they can be feeling very vulnerable and not know the best way to express themselves.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Have frequent meaningful conversations.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Discuss with your partner your insecurities and fears. Share positive and negative childhood memories that impacted how you view relationships today. If your partner experienced parental divorce, they are more likely to favor attitudes toward divorce and can even reduce commitment in relationships.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Meaningful conversations lead to a relationship that is built on honesty rather than ambiguity. By having open and judgment-free conversations, the other partner feels more inclined to discuss topics that they were scared to mention before and begins to feel safe in the relationship. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This leads to a relationship that is emotionally vulnerable and connected. Allow your partner to share past relationship issues since this can influence insecurities in your current relationship. Early adults’ own experience with instability impacts expectations for future relationships.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If your partner had a previously abusive relationship, understand that trust in your relationship will take more time to build. If your significant other had a difficult past regarding family issues or their love lives, your partner requires compassion, and their past can lead to positive conversations in which you can reassure your partner to build trust. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Reassuring your partner of their fears and doubts becomes easier and more frequent when you know about them. Reassurance also causes your partner to feel validated which could be most useful for individuals from previously abusive relationships. Discuss aspects that make each of you in the relationship feel safe and secure. If your partner had a previously toxic, jealous, or controlling partner, they may require more space in this relationship, and discussing this with your partner sets a more considerate expectation of each other.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Have satisfying sex.</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Sexual satisfaction often has an important role in determining the level of emotional intimacy in relationships.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Men consider a satisfactory sexual relationship as a tool for increasing emotional intimacy, whereas women may pursue emotional intimacy to feel sexually intimate with their partners.</span><span class=\"s1\"> You can spice up the bedroom to fulfill your and your partner&#8217;s needs by changing up your sex life. Try new sexual positions, or fantasies which you have discussed with your partner previously but did not due for whatever reason. Communicating about your sex life to make it more pleasurable also increases the likelihood that you and your partner view your sex life as enjoyable. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Discuss what both of you enjoy or dislike in the bedroom. Having safe words when you or your partner feel out of control can help in a situation to stop or take a break. Safe words can ease your worries when trying something new that makes either of you nervous or cautious. Partners are more likely to feel emotionally and sexually intimate with their partners when they perceive that their partner’s communication style is more positive, and this increases intimacy and enhances their relationship satisfaction.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> When both partners feel their sex life is satisfactory, they are more likely to view the relationship as satisfactory as well. There should be no stigmas involved in your relationship when discussing sex; both partners should feel comfortable and able to discuss what they like, dislike, and their boundaries.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">These are three things you can do to become or help your partner be more emotionally vulnerable in the relationship. Starting with an honest, heartfelt conversation with your partner can be a great start. How will you incorporate these tips into your life? Are there some tips you might already be successfully doing now? Which tip sounds more difficult for either your partner or even yourself? Just one of these tips can help you feel more secure and initiate and lead to better conversations in your relationship today! Give them a try.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

If you are reading this blog post, it’s probably because your partner cheated and you’re hoping to somehow rebuild your marriage. You are not alone. Couple therapists report that infidelity is one of the most damaging issues that couples can face.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Approximately 22-25% of men and 11-15% of women admit to having extramarital sex at least once during their marriage.</span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">You may feel lost, but there are essential steps that can be taken to repair the damage and restore the relationship. They will take great effort not just from your partner but from you too! In this post, we will be walking through five key tips on how to rebuild your marriage after an affair.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Refrain from making hot-headed decisions and seeking revenge.</b><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">When we are angry or hurt, we respond with angry feelings to feel less vulnerable and tend to make decisions without thinking them through as much. The desire to get revenge is common but acting on it is not healthy for you and will not bring anything positive to you or your relationship. In fact, it can do more damage &#8211; which will make recovering from the affair even more difficult. Sending angry texts to your significant other, contacting the person they cheated with (or that person’s partner), or bad-mouthing your partner to your children will just hurt you and make matters worse. If you are willing to make it work, focus on the steps that can be taken to make things better.</span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Choose to trust again.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Simply put, if you want to rebuild your relationship, you must relearn to trust your</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">partner: it is the only way. It is important to let go of whatever is out of your control. You cannot control your significant other or the people around them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Indeed, if you are willing to give them another chance, then you need to accept the fact that there is nothing you can do besides <i>trust </i>them. Think of trust as a conscious choice &#8211; one that acts as a solid base to a successful marriage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> You will not magically begin trusting your partner overnight, of course. Dr. Kennon V. Rider, a licensed psychologist who specializes in marriage and family therapy, provides her patients with a clever metaphor to help them understand the process of restoring trust.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Suppose that you must drive on the highway to get to work every morning. She suggests that if you are willing to get into a car and drive on the highway daily, it is because you implicitly trust that the other drivers will stay in their lanes and drive how they are supposed to. However, suppose one day another driver swerves into your lane and smashes into your car. Your car is totaled, and you are injured. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">After going to the hospital, you return home to heal. Finally, the day arrives when you must return to work in your new car. It is very hard, but you care a lot about that job and decide you want to keep it. Therefore, you will need to relearn how to trust the other drivers on the highway. On the way to work, you will probably be very cautious and keep a sharp eye on the other lanes, but eventually, you will realize that you cannot control the drivers – all you can control is your own driving. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you repeatedly get to work safely, you’ll be grateful and relieved. After some time, trusting the drivers will become easier.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Now think of the accident as infidelity; the driver that crashed into you is your partner. You will have to go through the same process of choosing to trust and letting go of what you cannot control. As time passes and your partner focuses on “staying in their lane”, trusting your significant other will become easier.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Reflect on what factors played a role in the occurrence of the affair.</b><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">To be clear: No matter the circumstances, having an affair is wrong. Unfortunately, it often happens, and many different factors can lead to it. A common way of treating infidelity in couple therapy is by helping couples understand how factors outside of their relationship &#8211; and even things inside of it that they could have contributed to &#8211; played a role in the affair.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">High stress, neglect, stagnant sex life, constant arguing, and overall low relationship satisfaction can lead individuals to cheat. It is important to remember that these issues don’t justify the affair; it is not your fault that they cheated. However, being honest with yourself and reflecting on how your own actions, as well as certain external factors, could have influenced the affair can allow you to forgive and mend the relationship by working on these issues.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Identifying things that you can change in your own behavior is the only way to have direct control over whether this happens again. If you felt like your sex life was lacking before the affair, for example, it may be a good idea to schedule moments during the week to strengthen your sexual intimacy and recapture some of the spark you had when you first got together.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Have a weekly date night with your partner.</b><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> As the two of you try to rebuild your relationship, remind yourself and your partner why the relationship is worth saving! Reserve one day out of the week to dress up and go somewhere nice – just you and your partner. Engage in spontaneous and novel activities with your partner, such as trying new restaurants, going dancing, or taking an art class. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Avoid talking about the affair, therapy, work, and other stressors of everyday life; these topics can be discussed at another time. Try to keep the conversation light, as it is helpful to take a break from constant worry and frustration.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>6</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Although it may feel awkward and forced at first, use this time to explore your new relationship together. Make date night a priority!</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Work on your communication.</b><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> You&#8217;re upset. That’s okay and understandable. Discovering your partner’s betrayal was probably an emotionally traumatic event since it violated your basic relationship assumptions.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>7</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> However, in moments of conflict, communication is key. The way you express yourself can change the direction and tone of a conversation. You and your significant other need to establish a “language” to be able to communicate transparently. You should focus on expressing the loss and trauma experienced due to the affair.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It is okay to go into depth about how you feel, but don’t go “on and on”. Use brief statements to not overwhelm your partner with too many thoughts at once. Also, stop periodically after you make a point. Pause to let your partner paraphrase, or summarize, and process what you just told them, and paraphrase when they pause for you. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Additionally, avoid blaming statements with “you”, such as “you are not affectionate”, and instead start them with “I”, such as “I don’t feel desired”. Using “you” statements will make your significant other feel attacked and more likely to become defensive. “I” statements will keep the focus on how you feel and what the main issue is, allowing both of you to brainstorm about what can be done to resolve it. When your partner is speaking, listen. As much as you want to interrupt, don&#8217;t. If turns to speak aren’t respected, the conversation will go nowhere. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Moreover, don’t mindread &#8211; in other words, don’t tell your significant other what they are thinking, wanting, or feeling. Focus on speaking for yourself. Lastly, avoid rebutting &#8211; instead of focusing on your reaction to your partner’s points, focus on listening and understanding what is being said.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>So, they cheated but you decided to give your marriage a second chance…<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you follow these 5 tips based on research and expert advice, you will be on the right track to restoring your marriage after infidelity. As explained above, reestablishing a healthy partnership requires openness to give and receive from your partner. Avoiding rash decisions, choosing to trust, accepting responsibility, prioritizing date night, and effective communication are the secret weapons of relationship restoration after an affair. However, these things are easier said than done. They may take time, and it may even be helpful to seek professional help. The light at the end of the tunnel might be dim right now, but this process may bring you and your partner closer than ever. It won’t be easy, but it will be worth it.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

Therefore, if you increase the level of emotional intimacy in your relationship, there is a possibility that these factors can improve with it and result in overall relationship satisfaction. So, <i>how </i>can you improve yours?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p11\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip#1: </b>Open Communication</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">Open communication means trying to speak clearly about the things that make you and your partner uncomfortable</span><span class=\"s1\">. This tip is essential to increasing levels of emotional intimacy in a relationship. Implementing open communication can help avoid future problems arising from perspectives on undisclosed or avoided topics</span><span class=\"s1\">. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, you can speak about things that you like or don’t like that your partner does, where you think the relationship stands, if you need space, etc. Another essential thing to speak about is boundaries and what you will or will not tolerate in the relationship, as well as listening to their opinion on the matter.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip #2: </b>Self-Disclosure </span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p14\"><span class=\"s1\">Aside from open communication, self-disclosure is imperative to increase emotional intimacy. One way that you can do this is by expressing your emotions to your partner and talking about pivotal experiences in your life. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p14\"><span class=\"s1\">If your partner does the same, make a conscious effort to be empathetic when they confide in you and show that you support and actively listen to them. This will help you feel connected to your partner on a deeper level, as well as make them feel that you trust them enough to disclose your feelings. As you share difficult experiences, even the small ones, there is a possibility that you will feel more emotionally connected to them and them to you</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>2</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip #3: </b>Capitalization </span></h2>\n<p class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s1\"><i><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></i></span><span class=\"s1\">The last important tip is capitalization. Essentially, capitalization is when good news is shared and celebrated with someone. As capitalization demonstrates a positive effect on relationships, show your partner that you care and are as excited as they are when they accomplish something</span><span class=\"s1\">. Show them that you are proud of them, and this will help them minimize feelings of discomfort and demonstrate to them that you think about them. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s1\">Celebrate each other’s victories and show each other how much you support one another. For example, if your partner gets accepted to the job of their dreams, you can celebrate with a romantic picnic, a trip, or something you have both been looking forward to doing. The message here is to show them that their accomplishments are as significant to you as they are to them, no matter how small or big they may seem.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Now that you understand the importance of emotional intimacy, the role it plays in your relationship, and some tips to improve it, what will you do?

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By <span class=\"s1\">Hadieh Zolfaghari</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you’re reading this blog post, then you’ve probably found the person who makes you the happiest, who you couldn’t imagine life without, and who you could see being your lifelong partner. You and this person come from different backgrounds, cultures, or races. Although you may not have anticipated it, these differences come with their own set of challenges as well as advantages. You may be starting to become aware of these challenges now, but don’t let them discourage you. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The increase in cultural diversity in the United States is causing intercultural romantic relationships (which can consist of partners from different religious, ethnic, racial, and/or language backgrounds) to become more and more common.</span><span class=\"s1\"> However, these relationships face higher levels of divorce and separation than intracultural relationships.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Despite their challenges, intercultural relationships create a unique environment in which people, such as you and your partner, have a lot to learn from each other and many ways to grow from the relationship. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, how can you make these intercultural relationships work?</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip #1: Surround yourselves with people who support and accept your relationship.</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When couples experience feelings of stigmatization or marginalization due to their identity as an interracial couple, this causes them to feel as though they should not be together, adding extra stress to the relationship.</span><span class=\"s1\"> This also makes them more likely to view their cultural identity and couple identity as separate &#8211; sometimes causing them to feel as though they must choose between the two.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Therefore, you should prioritize having a social network that supports your relationship and does not cause you and your partner to feel intense feelings of stigmatization or marginalization. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can do this by putting in the effort to educate and enlighten your close friends and family so that they are able to support you and your relationship, as well as by living in an area with high levels of general acceptance of intercultural relationships. Developing resiliency skills to prepare you to face the social opposition that may occur because of your intercultural or interracial relationship will also protect and strengthen your relationship. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip #2: Be aware of, express, and respond to each other’s emotions by prioritizing communication.</b> </span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Couples who share similar emotional processes are more likely to have stronger relationships and higher relationship satisfaction because they are able to offer emotional support to each other in more effective ways.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Romantic partners with effective emotional exchanges are also more likely to report higher rates of intimacy, trust, and commitment.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Because you and your partner were raised with different cultural identities, the two of you have likely developed different values, beliefs, and norms. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These, in turn, lead to the development of different emotional processes. Because of this, you and your partner must engage in open communication to better understand these culturally influenced aspects of each other and have more effective emotional exchanges. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You and your partner should regularly set aside time to speak about your emotions, any issues that you are experiencing, and how these issues may relate to your cultural backgrounds. It may be helpful to schedule a time to talk about these topics. You should also be open to regulating and adjusting your own emotions to better support your partner’s emotions. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Effective communication skills will also allow for effective conflict resolution skills, which are a strong asset to intercultural and interracial relationships.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip #3: Develop an appreciation for your partner’s culture, even though it is different from your own. </b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As partners, you must be willing to celebrate and appreciate your differences and respective cultures in order to be open in your relationship.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In order to do this, you and your partner should dedicate time, effort, and energy towards learning about each other’s cultures, celebrating them, and engaging in the traditions, customs, and languages associated with them. You and your partner could celebrate each other’s cultural holidays, try to learn each other’s native languages, go to each other’s cultural celebrations and events, and even travel to each other’s countries of origin if possible. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This will allow you and your partner to feel seen and appreciated by each other in many cases. It will also allow for a stronger relationship with your partner’s family who shares the same cultural, racial, or ethnic identity &#8211; especially if this identity is an integral part of their lifestyle.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip #4: Try to understand the lived experience and identity of your partner, but don’t overestimate how much of their experience you are able to understand. </b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When intercultural relationships progress, couples often learn a lot about each other’s lived experiences, causing them to develop an understanding of their partner’s identity. Demonstrating an understanding of your partner facilitates more intimacy in relationships.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> However, the concept of developing and demonstrating an understanding of romantic relationships is complex.</span><span class=\"s1\"> When a person overestimates how well and how deeply they understand their partner and this overestimation exceeds their partner’s estimation of how understood they personally feel, this can lead to poorer relationship quality.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This poorer relationship quality consists of the partner feeling as though they are less cared for and viewing their partner more negatively.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It is important to work towards building an understanding of the ways in which your partner’s cultural and racial identity has affected their lived experiences. At the same time, it is also important not to assume that you fully understand every aspect of your partner’s identity and its implications. Intimate communication and vulnerability through the sharing of your cultural identities, your relationships with your cultures, and how your lived experiences have been influenced by your cultures will allow you and your partner to further develop your understanding of each other in a healthy way. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You and your partner should regularly set aside time to communicate about past and current experiences related to your culture, any discrimination that you have experienced, and how these experiences made you feel. You should also take a genuine interest in your partner’s lived experiences and do your best to respect and understand these experiences. However, you must remember that it is important not to overestimate your level of understanding. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although you have a close personal relationship with your partner, you have not personally experienced their lives and their culture. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip #5: Develop and maintain a “we” mentality. </b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A “we” mentality refers to a mentality of unity between the partners of a romantic relationship and has proven to be a valuable method of promoting success in intercultural and interracial relationships. You and your partner should develop a united identity despite the differences in your ethnic and cultural backgrounds through aspects such as friendship, finding common ground, having similar goals, and commitment.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a couple, you can create a “we” mentality through friendship by allowing your friend</span><span class=\"s1\">s to bring you closer together despite your cultural differences.</span><span class=\"s1\"> You can do this by engaging in activities that remind you of your core friendship and by spending quality time together. Finding common ground within the differences that you experience as a couple will allow you to identify similarities that you can both relate to despite the differences that you may experience, also promoting relationship quality.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, two partners may have different ways of approaching problems yet share the same value system regarding problems in general. As a couple, you should find the common ground in the differences you experience and focus on the advantages that this common ground presents in your lives. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition, working toward similar goals will allow you two to focus on and use your strengths and feel as though you are a part of a unit, again supporting the “we” mentality.</span><span class=\"s1\"> You and your partner should identify common goals and work on them together as a team to accomplish this. Over time, increased commitment and ability to work effectively and positively alongside one another will also allow you to grow your united mentality.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>To wrap it up… </b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Intercultural and interracial romantic relationships pose a unique set of challenges that may be overwhelming and hard to navigate at first. But don’t let this scare you away from pursuing a relationship that could change your life in a positive way. Through your newfound knowledge and the guidance of these tips and skills, you now have the power to strengthen and preserve your own intercultural or interracial relationship. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Natalia Walcott</strong></p>\n<p>Every married couple remembers their honeymoon phase after their wedding. It probably involved frequent sex, lots of love and affection for each other, and a lack of arguments. However, once the honeymoon ends and life starts to settle in, you realize that marriage is not always going to be a fairy tale. Marriage takes a lot of hard work from both spouses. Sharing your life with someone else can be a big challenge but also offers many rewards. Here are twelve characteristics of successful marriages.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Communication</strong></h3>\n<p>Having good communication with your spouse is one of the most important things in a marriage. If you and your spouse have poor communication, you might have noticed that there is some trouble in paradise. Once you and your spouse start confronting each other with anger, tension, and hostility, it will cause communication to fail and a lack of listening and understanding to occur. However, not all communication is good communication &#8211; and not all disagreements are bad. In fact, one of the most damaging patterns of communication that couples get stuck in is a pursue-withdraw pattern, where one partner pushes for change or attention and the other partner withdraws or avoids discussing the issue. Being able to respectfully and effectively relay your feelings to your spouse without placing blame upon them is key.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Admiration and Respect</strong></h3>\n<p>Everyone wants to be respected and appreciated for who they are &#8211; especially by their spouse. Having support from your spouse means everything. Try to support your spouse’s achievements, help build up their self-esteem, and fulfill their emotional needs. Make sure you respect their individual differences as much as you respect their similarities to you; after all, differences can be sources of excitement and novelty in a relationship.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Companionship</strong></h3>\n<p>Make sure that both of you are making time for each other. Spend some quality time enjoying each other&#8217;s company by doing activities together that you both enjoy. If you want more ideas on fun things you can do, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/the-importance-of-date-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">read this post</a>. However, also take some time apart and hang out with other friends. Having space from your spouse and doing your own thing will make those special date nights together feel even more meaningful.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Spirituality and Values</strong></h3>\n<p>Having a shared sense of spirituality and values can be helpful in a marriage. Your faith can give you emotional, social, and spiritual support. Places of religious worship can be a source of friendships and activities for the couple to do together. Turning to your faith in times of hardship has offered spouses guidance in making important decisions regarding their marriage.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Commitment</strong></h3>\n<p>In order to make the marriage work, you both must be committed to each other. Marital sustainment is more attainable if the commitment is mutual. Marriage is not easy. It has its ups and downs, and in order to overcome those obstacles, a certain level of effort is required. If you have kids involved, commit to keeping the family together by putting in effort with your relationship with your spouse.</p>\n<h3><strong>6. Affection</strong></h3>\n<p>Make sure you are showing your spouse affection, whether that be mentally or physically. You should know their love language by now (if not, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/the-complete-guide-to-the-different-love-languages-and-what-they-mean/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here</a> to check out one of our earlier posts on this topic). Whether it be words of affirmation of or physical touch, make sure you fulfill your spouses need for affection and intimacy. Don’t forget to make time to have sex with your spouse. Meet each other’s sexual needs and try to spice things up from the usual bedroom routine (if you’re looking for some ideas, we wrote an earlier post on this too).</p>\n<h3><strong>7. Ability to Deal with Crises and Stress</strong></h3>\n<p>Nobody goes through life without facing some challenges. When you said, “I do,” you signed up to be there for your spouse “for better or for worse.” What sets spouses apart is how they can resolve their problems and manage stress in a constructive way. Whether you are faced with a personal issue or an issue as a couple, you should address it with your spouse in a healthy way. Work on having a greater tolerance with frustration and dealing with your anger. If necessary, take some space in order to process the crisis and stress. Try to not transfer your anger onto your partner. Remember that you both are a team and need to work together to fix your problems.</p>\n<h3><strong>8. Responsibility</strong></h3>\n<p>You both need to be able to take accountability for your roles and actions in the relationship, as well as your actions. In order for your marriage to be successful, make sure you are fair (which doesn’t necessarily mean equal) in how you divide responsibilities between you and your spouse. Putting most of the responsibilities onto your spouse &#8211; especially if you’re not taking on the majority of other types of responsibilities &#8211; will likely lead to them feeling overworked and underappreciated.</p>\n<h3><strong>9. Compassion</strong></h3>\n<p>There is no room for selfishness in a marriage. You cannot give 25% into your marriage yet expect 100% from your spouse. You both need to make it a priority to unselfishly attend to your partner’s needs as well as your own. Try to focus on “we” more than “I” or “you” – you’re a team and sometimes will need to put the needs of the team first.</p>\n<h3><strong>10. Empathy and Sensitivity</strong></h3>\n<p>As a spouse, you need to be able to identify with your spouse’s feelings, thoughts, and attitudes. Being able to listen to your partner confide in you, verbally express your support for them, and show how much you empathize with their feelings and emotions is necessary in having a successful marriage. There is a lot of evidence suggesting that emotional intimacy grows through the process of one person sharing vulnerable emotions with their partner and having their partner support them. So, try to share with your partner – and attend to them when they’re sharing with you. Those are really important moments. You don’t want to miss them.</p>\n<h3><strong>11. Honesty, Trust, and Fidelity</strong></h3>\n<p>Having the ability to trust your spouse without hesitation is one of the best feelings. You know that when they say they will do something; they will follow through with it. Knowing that your spouse is dependable and faithful to you creates peace and satisfaction in your marriage. Once trust is broken, it can be hard to build it back up. However, do not lose hope if that is the case for your marriage. Displaying remorse and making an effort to show your spouse that you care about them and want the marriage to work is a good first step in building back the trust. For more tips, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/your-partner-doesnt-trust-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">read this post</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>12. Adaptability, Flexibility, and Tolerance</strong></h3>\n<p>You and your spouse are likely not the same people that you were on your wedding day. As your marriage has progressed, the dynamics of it may have changed, and you must be able to adapt to these changes. Embrace who you and your spouse have become and continue building from there. Along those same lines, accept that the two of you will disagree sometimes – your different people after all! It is important to not adopt a “my way or the highway” type of approach. Being able to talk it out and come to a compromise is important.</p>\n<p>We know that it’s a tall order. Relationships are complex and can feel like a lot of work sometimes. But research shows that having a happy relationship is also one of the most important things we can do to have an overall happy life. So, it’s worth the effort!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

However, once the honeymoon ends and life starts to settle in, you realize that marriage is not always going to be a fairy tale&#8230;."

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Natalia Walcott</strong></p>\n<p>Love is both hard to define and a central part of most of our lives. There is no concrete definition of love that fits for everyone &#8211; our different perspectives of love come from our experiences and background. Love can be a feeling or emotion that you have for someone or it could be your actions towards them. Regardless of your personal definition, having intimate relationships with people that we love is important. These relationships matter because they are unique experiences that can’t be replicated. To love and to be loved are basic human needs. Most people would dread the thought of going through life’s journeys alone. Being lonely and socially isolated never feels good – a fact vividly illustrated by lockdowns due to the COVID pandemic. It’s in our nature to foster connections with others. When times are hard, we look towards those who we know love and care for us for comfort and guidance. It is through these interactions with others and our environment that we truly get to learn about ourselves. Without these intimate relationships, we can’t fully grasp or appreciate all the experiences that have given our lives meaning, purpose, and value.</p>\n<p>Have you ever been having a bad day and a small gesture or word from somebody that you love changed your whole mood and brightened up your day? If you have, you know how special and powerful that feeling is. Having people in your life that know just how to comfort you when you are distressed is essential. That is just one of many examples of how relationships are essential to giving us emotional comfort and have a lasting impact on our daily lives. Believe it or not, we are biologically in tune with the people that we share an intimate bond with. Even the presence or touch from a loved one can comfort you in a stressful moment. There is even evidence that a hug from our partners after a stressful day can reduce the stress hormone (cortisol) levels in our blood for the rest of the evening. When you hold your partner’s hand, you’re affecting their nervous system by empowering them to stay strong despite the problem they’re facing. Researchers can even see beneficial changes in the brain (in an fMRI machine) when people get to hold their partner’s hand. Who would’ve thought that a simple grasp of a hand could hold so much power and exert so much influence? It’s no wonder that we feel so happy when this occurs.</p>\n<p>Relationships can bring about happiness in multiple ways. Whether it’s financial, sexual, or even health-wise, they have a significant impact on your well-being. The impact that loving someone else can have on you is shocking. It is important to understand the benefits of being in a relationship with someone you love.</p>\n<p>Intimate relationships can bring about happiness because of the positive effects they can have on your physical health. Studies have shown that those who are in happy relationships and can constructively resolve conflicts are less likely to get sick with the common cold after being exposed to the virus. Your heart and immune system are also stronger when you have less conflict and hostility in your relationship. Since you and your partner aren’t fighting, you’re experiencing less stress mentally and physically. Well at least just in your relationship. A stressful job or unforeseen circumstances can still come and negatively affect you. Have you ever seen/ met a couple that’s been married for 50+ years, still madly in love, and want to know how to achieve that within your own relationship? I know I have. Every relationship is different, but the benefits of a relationship with that type of longevity is consistent across spouses. Those in committed relationships live longer than those that are divorced or in an unhealthy relationship. All of that arguing and fighting isn’t good for you in the long run. You are also more likely to have support with life’s challenges because you have a partner helping you along the way.</p>\n<p>Intimate relationships also promote happiness through sexual intimacy. People say that sex is the activity that makes them the happiest. Being able to be physically close to your partner and connect on an intimate level is such a great feeling. If you are in a healthy relationship, you and your partner hopefully have a good and consistent sex life. However, if not, be sure to check out one of our recent blog posts <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/top-3-reasons-to-have-more-sex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Being in a stable and happy relationship also tends to benefit couples financially. Although being married costs more money, you and your partner are more likely to accumulate wealth than if you were single, separated, or divorced. It’s cheaper to have someone to share housing and other costs with. Also, being in a stable relationship tends to reduce careless or unnecessary spending and gets people thinking about saving for the future.</p>\n<p>Relationships can affect our subjective well-being. This can depend on the type of relationship you have with your significant other. You are more likely to be happier within your relationship when you are married, as opposed to being unmarried. However, not everyone in a relationship is happy. You probably have many single friends that are thriving and happy as can be despite not being in a relationship. It’s the quality of your relationship that really matters. This can be a bigger determining factor of your overall subjective well-being than your satisfaction with work, finances, friendship, health, etc. You might love your partner, but if your relationship is negatively affecting you, it might be time to have a conversation with your partner about your relationship moving forward.</p>\n<p>When your relationship is of high quality and endures the hardships and obstacles that you and your partner may face, happiness is sure to follow. Love plays a role in our everyday lives, whether it is with a partner, family member, or friend. Having someone that loves and supports you is an amazing feeling. The benefits of being in a healthy, loving relationship speak for themselves. Love matters so much. Try to foster meaningful relationships to not only improve your quality of life but to build memories that will last a lifetime!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Jennifer Mckinnon</strong></p>\n<p>Erectile dysfunction (or ED) is an uncomfortable topic to talk about. After all, what man wants to admit that they can’t get erect? Sometimes, the fear of being the butt of jokes is greater than the courage to be honest.</p>\n<p>If you’re suffering from ED, know that you’re not the only one facing this condition. Erectile dysfunction <a href=\"https://theenhancedmale.com/blogs/the-enhanced-males-knowledge-center/study-men-with-erectile-dysfunction-and-the-impact-on-their-lives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">affects over 30 million men</a> in the United States. Aside from the physical symptoms, ED causes feelings of decreasing confidence, shame, and inadequacy.</p>\n<p>With all that said, it can affect any <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4005452/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">relationship</a>—even long-lasting ones like marriages. How? Let’s find out.</p>\n<h2><strong>How It Starts</strong></h2>\n<p>Before getting to the main subject at hand, here’s an overview of how erectile dysfunctions happen to understand its impact better.</p>\n<p>Erections happen when blood continually flows through a person’s penis. Sexual thoughts or excitement or direct contact stimulates this said blood flow. When something wrong happens while the erection stage is happening, ED begins to manifest. Often, erectile dysfunction can be caused by an underlying medical condition, such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, etc.</p>\n<p>Possible symptoms can include erection troubles and decreased sexual desires. If you or your partner are experiencing these symptoms, you may want to consult a professional for assistance, especially if they’re frequently happening.</p>\n<h3><strong>Causes</strong></h3>\n<p>Erectile dysfunctions have several causes, which include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<h3><strong>Physical Factors</strong></h3>\n<p>Most ED cases come from physical factors. These are some of the typical causes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hypertension</li>\n<li>Sleep disorders</li>\n<li>Diabetes</li>\n<li>Drug use</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Psychological Factors</strong></h3>\n<p>The brain plays a role in causing erections. These mind-affecting factors can interfere with the erection process, laying the ground down for future dysfunctions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stress</li>\n<li>Anxiety</li>\n<li>Depression</li>\n<li>Relationship issues/problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>How EDs Can Affect Relationships</strong></h2>\n<p>Erectile dysfunction isn’t a sexy topic, which is why many chose to keep mum about their condition. The thought of not being able to get erect and satisfy their partners sexually brings men with ED a great deal of shame. This leads them to doubt themselves as partners or husbands, shutting themselves off out of fear.</p>\n<p>Men cope with the shame in various ways. Aside from closing themselves off, some end up blaming their partners for their erection problems. If you’re suffering from this, know better than to commit such a mistake.</p>\n<p>ED not only affects men, but women are impacted too. Women in these relationships wonder if their capabilities in the bedroom aren’t enough to satisfy their partner&#8217;s wants and needs. As this self-doubt grows, it may lead them to doubt their partner’s commitment and loyalty.</p>\n<p>A healthy amount of sex is essential in relationships. It’s more than just getting your dose of bodily pleasure. <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/105754-this-is-how-much-sex-is-normal-in-a-long-term-relationship-according-to-an-expert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sex connects partners on an intimate level.</a> “Sex is the glue that keeps us together and the spice that makes our joint life exciting,” says author and licensed couple’s therapist Laurie Watson.</p>\n<p>The psychological baggage that comes with EDs causes partners to walk on eggshells around each other and matters in the bedroom. The more you tiptoe around this issue, the worse your problems and frustrations will become. And if those problems aren’t solved, they will erode your relationship.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to Treat Erectile Dysfunction</strong></h2>\n<p>Fortunately, most cases of ED are temporary and treatable, especially if you address them early. You may want to look at these options to get rid of the problem:</p>\n<h3><strong>Open up and Talk about It</strong></h3>\n<p>Many men suffer from erectile dysfunctions. You’re not alone in facing this. Admitting and acknowledging it is hard, but it’s an essential step to curing the problem.</p>\n<p>Even though it’s 2021, toxic masculinity still prevents men from opening up about it since they don’t want to be shamed and laughed at by fellow men. So if anyone, even your closest friends, ridicules you and questions your masculinity for having ED, pay no mind to their insensitivity.</p>\n<p>One of the first things you can do is to be completely honest about it to your partner. If anyone can show you understanding and compassion, it’s your other half.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ask Help from Professionals</strong></h3>\n<p>Once you’ve cleared the air with your partner, you can seek help from experts. For relationship problems, approach a licensed counselor or therapist for assistance. Talking about ED’s effects on your mental health will help you and your partner mend your relationship’s fences. Things won’t be okay right away, so you have to be patient and take it slow.</p>\n<p>For medical queries, go to your doctor. They will be able to explain the causes and symptoms of your condition clearly and thoroughly and provide treatment options. The first step to cure ED entirely is to address the underlying cause. If it’s hypertension, your doctor will prescribe medication and lifestyle changes to lower your high blood pressure.</p>\n<h3><strong>Take Medications</strong></h3>\n<p>After consulting your doctor for help, they may prescribe medication to help you manage the underlying health condition causing ED and address the inability to achieve or sustain an erection. Note that certain medications may have side effects. If you experience any of them, go to your doctor for further consultation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Shift Your Lifestyle</strong></h3>\n<p>Lifestyle changes may be necessary to fight off erectile dysfunction. Men with ED should practice the following habits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quitting smoking</li>\n<li>Reducing or stopping alcohol consumption</li>\n<li>Quitting drug use</li>\n<li>Increased regular exercise</li>\n<li>Healthy weight maintenance</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Use Penis Pumps</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://theenhancedmale.com/collections/penis-pumps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Penis pumps</a> or vacuum pumps are viable ED treatment options. They help increase blood flow to the penis, keeping the erection maintained. These devices may look and sound intimidating, especially for people who’ve just known about their existence. Don’t worry, though. Penis pumps are generally safe to use as long as you follow instructions correctly and don’t have specific underlying conditions.</p>\n<p>These pumps come in <a href=\"https://theenhancedmale.com/products/bathmate-hercules-penis-enhancement-pump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">various forms</a> and have unique features. Before buying one, do your research about the ins and outs of penis pumps. This way, you’ll know what you’ll be getting yourself into. If you have a history of blood clots or are taking blood-thinning medication, consult your doctor before using a penis pump.</p>\n<p>Always ask your doctor’s professional input every time you want to try an alternative treatment for erectile dysfunction. Some treatments may have serious side effects, and you want to avoid that as much as possible.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Dealing with erectile dysfunctions can be tough on relationships. Thankfully, there are more than enough resources and information to deal with the condition. But before you get to treating ED, you have to take the first step of acknowledging and talking about it to your partner. Things will be a lot less stressful if you’re honest about what you’re going through from the beginning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",
