And, like other couples, those in the LGBTQ+ community may want to commemorate their journey in ways that resonate with their shared experiences. Whether it&#8217;s the memory of the first date, moving in together, or coming out (either individually or as a couple), every milestone represents a new chapter in the relationship that deserves recognition.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Relationship Milestones</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A relationship milestone can be universally recognized moments such as anniversaries and engagements, or deeply personal ones like the first shared holiday or adopting a pet. These milestones symbolize growth, commitment, and the intertwining of two lives in various degrees of depth and significance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, for LGBTQ+ couples, some milestones may hold unique weight or meaning due to the specific challenges and experiences associated with being a part of this community. For instance, the act of coming out as a couple might represent not just a declaration of love but also an act of courage in the face of societal expectations or prejudices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional milestones like engagements or weddings might carry added emotion for those who have fought for the right to legally and openly celebrate their love. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Celebrate Milestones?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relationships, like any journey, are composed of moments. Some fleeting, some profound, but all weaving together to tell the story of a shared life. But why is it essential to pause and celebrate these moments? Here&#8217;s why:</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strengthening the Bond Between Partners </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Celebrations act as reminders of why you chose one another and how you&#8217;ve grown together. Creating Lasting Memories and Traditions Milestones offer the perfect occasion to create and maintain traditions. Whether it&#8217;s revisiting the cafe where you had your first date every year or watching a particular movie on your &#8220;anniversary,&#8221; these traditions become treasured rituals. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common Milestones and How to Make Them Special</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every relationship has its milestones, moments that mark significant steps in the journey of love and commitment. While some are shared by many, others may be deeply personal, resonating with the unique narratives of each couple. Here&#8217;s a look at some common milestones for many couples, along with suggestions:</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First Date Anniversary: </span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visit the Place Where You First Met: Whether it was a coffee shop, a park, or a mutual friend&#8217;s party, returning to that spot can evoke memories of those first sparks.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recreate the Date: Try to wear similar outfits, order the same food, or play the song that was in the background. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving in Together: A New Chapter Combining your lives under one roof is a significant step:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a Shared Space: Dedicate a space in your home to display mementos of your relationship journey, be it photographs, trinkets, or notes.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anniversary of Coming Out as a Couple: </span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Celebrate Your Bravery: Take a moment to reflect on the courage it took for both of you to come out as a couple. Maybe write each other a letter detailing your feelings from that time.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank Supporters: Consider throwing a small get-together or sending notes to friends and family who stood by you, showing appreciation for their unwavering support.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engagement &amp; Marriage: </span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rainbow-Themed Celebrations: Incorporate the colors of the pride flag into your décor, outfits, or even the cake, celebrating your love in all its vibrant hues.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose LGBTQ+ Supportive Venues: Opt for venues or vendors known to support LGBTQ+ causes or rights. Your special day can also be a statement of advocacy and support.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adoption or Surrogacy Milestones: </span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Share Your Story: Document your journey, from the decision to expand your family to the day it happens. Sharing this with friends, family, or even publicly can inspire other LGBTQ+ couples considering a similar path.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create New Traditions: As you begin this chapter, introduce new rituals and traditions that honor your unique family&#8217;s story, ensuring that your child understands and celebrates their roots.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are several traditional milestones in relationships, each couple&#8217;s journey is distinct and the moments you choose to celebrate should reflect that uniqueness. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ways to Craft Your Own Milestones</span></h3>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personalize Your Celebration:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crafting a Celebration that Speaks to Your Unique Story: Not all significant moments fit into conventional categories. Maybe it&#8217;s the day you both adopted a pet, the first time you traveled abroad together, or even the evening you cooked a meal together. Find those moments that resonate deeply with your relationship&#8217;s narrative and honor them in your own special way.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Involving the Community:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incorporate Elements that Connect You with the Broader LGBTQ+ Community: Your love story exists within the context of a vibrant and diverse community. Celebrate milestones by attending LGBTQ+ events, collaborating with community organizations, or even hosting gatherings that bring together other LGBTQ+ couples to share their stories and build connections.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staying True to Yourselves:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emphasize the Importance of Authentic Celebrations Over Societal Expectations: While it&#8217;s natural to be influenced by societal norms and traditions, it&#8217;s essential to remember that your relationship is yours alone. Don&#8217;t feel pressured to celebrate in ways that don&#8217;t resonate with you. Instead, focus on what feels genuine and meaningful for both of you. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In creating your unique milestones, you&#8217;re not just marking time; you&#8217;re cherishing the individual moments that make your relationship extraordinary. By personalizing celebrations, involving the community, and staying true to yourselves, you ensure that each milestone is a genuine reflection of your shared journey.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practical Tips for Meaningful Celebrations</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most meaningful commemorations often come from genuine gestures, thoughtfulness, and a dash of creativity. Here are some tips to ensure your relationship milestones are celebrated without unnecessary complications:</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focus on the Sentiment, rather than the Price:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You Don&#8217;t Need to Break the Bank to Create a Memorable Experience: It&#8217;s the sentiment, not the price tag, that counts. A picnic under the stars, a homemade gift, or even a heartfelt letter can be more memorable than expensive gifts or lavish parties. Remember, creativity can often be the best currency.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incorporate Symbols:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use Symbols that Resonate with Your Journey: Whether it&#8217;s the pride flag, specific colors that hold meaning to you both, or even a song that&#8217;s become &#8216;yours,&#8217; incorporate these elements into your celebrations.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Document the Moments:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider Photography, Journaling, or Even Vlogging: Capturing memories allows you to revisit them. Hire a local photographer for a photoshoot, keep a shared journal where you jot down your feelings and experiences, or create a vlog capturing your day. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engage in Acts of Giving:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Milestones by Giving Back to the LGBTQ+ Community: Transform your celebrations into acts of kindness. Consider donating to an LGBTQ+ charity, volunteering together at an event, or even starting a fundraiser. Celebrating love by spreading love amplifies the significance of the milestone.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Revisit and Reflect:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make it a Tradition to Look Back on Past Celebrations: As you accumulate more milestones, set aside time during each celebration to reflect on previous ones. Re-watch videos, read old letters, or simply reminisce about past events. This practice not only reinforces the bond but also showcases how far you&#8217;ve come together.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By focusing on what truly matters and being mindful of these practical tips, you can ensure every milestone is celebrated in the most heartfelt way.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Celebrating milestones, both big and small, is more than just marking dates on a calendar or throwing a party. These moments of acknowledgment act as anchors in the ever-flowing stream of life, grounding us in memories and shared experiences. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you move forward in your love journey, remember to pause, cherish, and celebrate it. Create your own traditions, invent new milestones, and find distinctive ways to commemorate your love. It&#8217;s these moments that truly define our shared human experience. Here&#8217;s to love, in all its forms and colors!</span></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p><strong>by Jackson Weiser and Charlotte Cremers</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be both thrilling and intimidating to date someone with more sexual experience &#8211; especially someone who has explored many different aspects of their sexuality. In this article, we&#8217;ll delve into tips for a relationship with a more sexually experienced partner and offer guidance for how to navigate this with grace and confidence. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Understanding Your Feelings</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When dating someone more sexually experienced, it&#8217;s natural to experience a range of emotions, including insecurity and uncertainty. It&#8217;s often helpful to acknowledge these feelings and address them in a healthy way. Here are some key points to consider:</span></p>\n<p><b>Potential insecurities or uncertainties:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It&#8217;s common to feel insecure about your own level of experience compared to your partner&#8217;s. Remember that everyone has their own unique journey, and your worth as an individual is not solely defined by your sexual history (just like your partner’s isn’t).</span></p>\n<p><b>The importance of self-acceptance and self-confidence:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You can’t change what you haven’t (or have!) experienced yet, but you can change how you frame a lack of experience. It can be an exciting thing that you have exploration and learning in front of you. You deserve a partner that is excited to go through this process with you and patient to go at a pace you feel comfortable with. Build your self-confidence by also acknowledging other positive qualities and the unique attributes you bring to the relationship.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Embracing Open Communication</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Effective </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/7-steps-to-understanding-the-importance-of-communication-in-a-relationship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">communication</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is crucial in any relationship, especially when it comes to matters of intimacy and sexuality.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Engage in </b><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/do-you-have-trouble-sharing-your-thoughts-and-feelings/\"><b>honest conversations</b></a><b> about sexual history</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: While discussing sexual history can feel uncomfortable, it&#8217;s essential to have open and honest conversations with your partner. Try to approach these discussions with curiosity and respect, creating a safe space for both of you to share your experiences. Remember that transparency can strengthen your bond and increase understanding.</span></li>\n<li><b>Address concerns and ask questions respectfully</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you have concerns or questions about your partner&#8217;s past experiences, it&#8217;s crucial to address them in a respectful manner. Try to avoid judgment, assumptions, or pressure to disclose; instead, express your thoughts with empathy and understanding. Sexual experience, or the lack thereof, simply reflects what you have or have not done &#8211; not who you are as a person. </span></li>\n<li><b>Open communication can increase understanding and connection</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Engaging in open communication about sexual history can lead to a deeper understanding of your partner&#8217;s desires, boundaries, and preferences. This knowledge can create a stronger emotional and physical connection between you. By actively listening and empathizing, you can build trust and foster an environment of mutual respect.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, open communication isn&#8217;t solely about discussing the past but also about ongoing dialogue regarding your present desires and expectations. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Cultivating Trust and Mutual Respect</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a strong foundation of trust and mutual respect is vital when dating someone more sexually experienced. Here are suggestions for how to do that:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Build trust:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Trust is essential for a healthy and fulfilling relationship. Feeling as though you can trust your partner to be compassionate when you bring up sensitive topics is crucial. This level of trust can take some time to cultivate in your relationship. It might be a good idea to take incremental steps in cultivating trust and mutual respect with your partner by seeing how they react when you share your more surface-level insecurities and feelings. If they reciprocate and demonstrate compassion, then you can move on to sharing your deeper thoughts and feelings. This is a good way to feel safe when bringing up the topic of sexual experience with your partner. </span></li>\n<li><b>Set boundaries and discuss comfort levels</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Boundaries are essential for maintaining a healthy relationship. Discuss and establish clear boundaries that align with both partners&#8217; comfort levels. Communicate your boundaries openly and respectfully, and encourage your partner to do the same. By openly discussing boundaries, you can create a safe and respectful space for </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-promote-intimacy-with-communication/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exploring intimacy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> together.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><b>Learning from Each Other</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When dating someone more sexually experienced, there is a unique opportunity to learn and grow together as a couple. Here are key points to consider in embracing this opportunity:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Explore the opportunity to learn and grow together</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Try to view your partner&#8217;s experience as an opportunity for personal growth and discovery. Embrace the chance to learn from their insights, techniques, and perspectives. Likewise, your own unique perspective can enrich their understanding. By sharing openly and honestly, you can foster a deep sense of connection and mutual growth.</span></li>\n<li><b>Encourage a supportive and non-competitive mindset:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It&#8217;s essential to maintain a supportive and non-competitive mindset when exploring intimacy with someone more sexually experienced. Try to avoid comparing yourself to their past partners or feeling inadequate. Instead, try to focus on building a healthy and fulfilling connection based on trust, respect, and shared exploration. Celebrate each other&#8217;s unique journeys and experiences.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more tips on overcoming sexual difficulties in your relationship, click </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-overcome-sexual-difficulties-in-your-relationship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Exploring New Experiences</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being with a more sexually-experienced partner can also be an exciting opportunity. Here are some ideas on how to take advantage of it:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Discuss the potential for trying new things together</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Openly communicate with your partner about your desires to explore new experiences. Discuss your fantasies, interests, and curiosities. Explore the potential for trying new activities that can deepen your intimacy and connection. Be receptive to your partner&#8217;s suggestions as well, creating a space for mutual exploration and growth.</span></li>\n<li><b>Open-mindedness and curiosity</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Embrace an open-minded and curious approach to exploring new experiences. Be willing to step out of your comfort zone and try things that may be unfamiliar. Allow yourself to embrace the pleasure and growth that comes with exploring uncharted territory.</span></li>\n<li><b>Consent and mutual enjoyment</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Consent is of utmost importance in any sexual encounter. Prioritize open and </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-talk-about-the-status-and-future-of-your-relationship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ongoing communication</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about boundaries, desires, and comfort levels. Respect each other&#8217;s boundaries and check in for enthusiastic consent before trying something new. Remember that the key is mutual enjoyment and pleasure for both partners, creating a safe and satisfying experience.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><b>Seeking Support</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you and your partner find yourselves facing challenges or uncertainties that feel overwhelming, consider online relationship support as an option. The </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OurRelationship</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> program can help you and your partner develop more effective communication to discuss your core issues without judgment.

      "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The landscape of relationships is expanding beyond traditional norms at an accelerating pace. It has become increasingly possible for you and your partner to consider and experiment with new relationship dynamics. By exploring alternatives to monogamy (the relationship agreement that sexual and romantic behavior is only shared with one partner at a time), individuals and couples can create relationships that better align with their needs, desires, and values. One such alternative is ethical non-monogamy (ENM).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Ethical non-monogamy, also known as consensual non-monogamy, is a relationship structure that allows partners to engage in and/or pursue romantic or sexual behavior with multiple people at the same time, with the full knowledge and consent of all parties involved. It challenges the notion that sexual and romantic exclusivity is the only valid or viable option for committed romantic partnerships–emphasizing open </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/7-steps-to-understanding-the-importance-of-communication-in-a-relationship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">communication</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, honesty, and mutual consent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   In this article, we provide an in-depth exploration of ethical non-monogamy and help you determine if it’s a good fit for you or your relationship. We will delve into different types of ethical non-monogamous relationships, discuss their defining characteristics, and provide insights into the challenges and benefits they may present. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Types of ENM Relationships</b></h2>\n<h3><b>Casual Dating</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Casual dating involves engaging in non-exclusive and non-committed connections with multiple individuals. It is characterized by a more relaxed and informal approach to dating, where individuals explore romantic or sexual connections without the expectation of exclusivity or long-term commitment. It can allow for a broader range of experiences and interactions with various people.</span></p>\n<p><b>Emphasizing personal growth and exploration: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Casual dating is often associated with the desire for independence, personal growth, and self-discovery. It can provide an opportunity to explore different types of relationships, learn more about one&#8217;s own preferences, and expand social and emotional horizons. It can be a space for individuals to discover what they truly desire in a romantic or sexual partnership, as well as to explore their own boundaries and desires.</span></p>\n<p><b>Setting clear expectations and boundaries: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without inherent exclusivity or commitment, it is especially helpful to establish and communicate personal boundaries and desires with each partner. This includes agreeing upon levels of emotional involvement, frequency of interactions, and communication. By setting clear boundaries and having open conversations, individuals can navigate casual dating with transparency and respect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more general tips on talking about the status and future of your relationship, click </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-talk-about-the-status-and-future-of-your-relationship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Open Relationships</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Open relationships are a form of ethical non-monogamy that allows individuals in a committed partnership to engage in sexual (although not necessarily romantic) exploration and experiences with other people outside of their primary relationship. Ideally, the primary partnership remains the central foundation, but there is an understanding and acceptance that sexual encounters with others can occur.</span></p>\n<p><b>Boundaries, rules, and consent: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open relationships thrive on clear boundaries, rules, and consent between partners. This involves open and honest communication about what is acceptable within the relationship, including guidelines for engaging with others. Partners may establish rules such as using protection, informing each other about outside interactions, or setting limits on the frequency or nature of encounters. Regular discussions and ongoing consent are crucial to maintain trust and ensure the emotional well-being of all involved.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Swinging</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Swinging is a form of ethical non-monogamy that involves consensual partner swapping or engaging in group sexual activities. Swingers may attend events where they can meet and interact with other couples or individuals interested in non-monogamous experiences. It focuses on shared sexual exploration and pleasure within a consensual and respectful environment.</span></p>\n<p><b>Establishing rules and boundaries for sexual encounters: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swinging relationships thrive on clear rules and boundaries established by all parties involved. Couples or individuals in the swinging community often have discussions to establish guidelines regarding the types of activities they are comfortable with, the level of involvement desired, and any specific limitations or preferences. These rules and boundaries help ensure that everyone&#8217;s comfort levels are respected and that experiences are enjoyable for all participants.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Being Monogamish</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Being “monogamish” refers to a relationship dynamic that falls on the spectrum between monogamy and non-monogamy. It involves a largely exclusive partnership where both individuals may be open to occasional non-monogamous experiences or have agreed-upon allowances for exploring connections outside the relationship. Being monogamish allows for a level of flexibility and openness while still maintaining the central commitment to the primary partnership.</span></p>\n<p><b>Negotiating boundaries and expectations: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Negotiating boundaries and expectations is an essential part of being monogamish. Partners must have ongoing discussions about what is permissible and what is not, ensuring that both individuals feel comfortable and respected within the agreed-upon arrangement. This may include discussing limits on emotional involvement, specific rules for engaging with others, or guidelines for communication and disclosure. Regular check-ins and open dialogue can help maintain trust and ensure that the boundaries set are still meeting the needs of both partners.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Polyamory</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Polyamory is a form of ethical non-monogamy characterized by the practice of having multiple romantic or emotional relationships simultaneously, with the knowledge and consent of all involved. It goes beyond casual or purely sexual encounters and focuses on fostering deep emotional connections with multiple partners. Polyamory is based on principles such as open communication, honesty, and the belief that love and affection are not limited resources.</span></p>\n<p><b>Nurturing emotional connections: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partners in polyamory strive to foster deep emotional connections with each other, similar to those found in traditional monogamous relationships. This involves active communication, vulnerability, and investing time and effort to build and maintain emotional bonds with multiple partners.</span></p>\n<p><b>Managing jealousy and communication: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like any relationship, polyamory may bring up feelings of jealousy or insecurity. Effective communication skills, such as expressing needs and concerns, actively listening, and practicing empathy, play a vital role in navigating jealousy and maintaining healthy relationships. Establishing clear (but reasonable) boundaries, discussing expectations, and providing reassurance can also help to </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-reduce-jealousy-in-your-relationship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduce jealousy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> within polyamorous relationships.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Polygamy</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Polygamy is a type of ethical non-monogamy that involves having multiple spouses at the same time. This can appear in different forms, including polygyny (one man having multiple wives) or polyandry (one woman having multiple husbands). </span></p>\n<p><b>Cultural and religious aspects: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polygamy has historical and cultural roots in various societies around the world. It is often associated with specific religious or cultural traditions, such as certain sects of Islam, Mormonism, or indigenous cultures. In these contexts, polygamy may be viewed as a religious or spiritual practice, a way to strengthen family and community ties, or a means to address practical or societal needs.</span></p>\n<p><b>Legal considerations and challenges: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polygamy poses legal challenges in many jurisdictions. In countries where it is not legally recognized, having multiple spouses may be illegal or subject to criminal sanctions. In places where it is legally recognized, there may be specific regulations and requirements regarding marriage licenses, inheritance rights, and benefits. Legal complexities often arise regarding marital rights, custody arrangements, and financial obligations.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Polyfidelity</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Polyfidelity is a form of ethical non-monogamy that involves the establishment of exclusive multiple-partner relationships. Unlike other forms of non-monogamy where individuals may have relationships with multiple partners, polyfidelity emphasizes committed and exclusive bonds within a limited group. It usually consists of three or more individuals who are committed to each other emotionally, romantically, and sexually. The goal is usually to create a deep sense of connection, trust, and commitment among all members, fostering a sense of family or chosen kinship.</span></p>\n<p><b>Balancing emotional intimacy and autonomy: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polyfidelity involves navigating the delicate balance between emotional intimacy and individual autonomy. While there is a commitment to the group, each individual still maintains their own personal autonomy and may have their own unique connections and dynamics within the polyfidelity structure. Communication, negotiation, and establishing clear boundaries are vital to ensure that everyone&#8217;s emotional needs are met while respecting each person&#8217;s individuality.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Deciding If Ethical Non-Monogamy is Right for You</b></h2>\n<h3><b>Considering personal values and relationship goals</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Evaluate your personal values and relationship goals to determine if ethical non-monogamy aligns with what you want for yourself and your partnerships. Consider factors such as emotional intimacy, commitment, autonomy, and the types of connections you seek. It is important that all individuals involved share compatible values and have a shared vision for the relationship(s) moving forward.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Open and honest communication with your partner(s)</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Ethical non-monogamy requires open and honest communication with your partner(s). Initiate conversations about your </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/do-you-have-trouble-sharing-your-thoughts-and-feelings/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thoughts and feelings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding non-monogamy, expressing your desires, concerns, and expectations. It is essential to create a safe space where all parties involved can express their emotions and actively listen to one another. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Getting support</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   If you are unsure about whether ethical non-monogamy is right for your relationship or if you encounter difficulties along the way, consider seeking support or guidance. </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/about/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OurRelationship</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offers free programs that are designed to help you and your partner with problems in your relationship. They can help you and your partner learn how to better communicate so you may discuss your issues without judgment.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Exploring different relationship dynamics can be a transformative journey that leads to personal growth and a deeper understanding of oneself and others. Ethical non-monogamy encourages us to create relationships that align with our authentic selves. Remember to consider your personal values, relationship goals, and individual capacities for emotional connections and that your journey towards finding the right relationship dynamic will be unique to you.</span></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p><strong>by Jackson Weiser and Charlotte Cremers</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many romantic relationships, commitment often plays a vital role in fostering trust, stability, and long-term happiness. It serves as a strong foundation that allows individuals to build a deeper emotional connection and navigate the challenges that come their way. Unfortunately, many individuals still struggle with fully committing to their partner–which can make it more difficult for them to reach their relationship goals.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Understanding “Commitment Issues”</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Commitment issues” refer to emotional barriers or fears that prevent individuals from fully engaging in or sustaining a committed romantic relationship. It involves a reluctance or resistance to enter into long-term commitments or maintain a deep emotional connection with a partner. It is sometimes referred to as an “avoidant” attachment style.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Commitment issues struggles</b></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Fear of commitment</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A pervasive fear or anxiety surrounding the idea of committing to a long-term relationship. This fear may stem from concerns about losing personal freedom, fear of intimacy, or the possibility of being hurt or rejected.</span></li>\n<li><b>Difficulty making long-term plans</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Individuals with commitment issues may struggle to make or follow through with plans that extend into the future. They may avoid discussions or decisions regarding important milestones in the relationship, such as moving in together, getting married, or</span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/five-tips-to-maintain-a-healthy-relationship-before-having-a-baby/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> starting a family</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n<li><b>Avoidance of relationship labels</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: People with commitment issues may resist or avoid defining the relationship with labels like &#8220;boyfriend&#8221; or &#8220;girlfriend.&#8221; They may prefer to keep the relationship label-free, fearing the responsibilities or expectations associated with formal relationship titles.</span></li>\n<li><b>Pattern of short-term relationships</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Commitment-averse individuals often find themselves in a series of short-term relationships that end when their partners begin to push for more commitment. They may experience difficulty sustaining long-term connections due to a fear of commitment or a tendency to become emotionally detached after a certain period.</span></li>\n<li><b>Inability to envision a future together</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Those with commitment issues struggle to imagine or plan a shared future with their partner. They may have difficulty picturing themselves in a committed, long-term relationship and may avoid discussing or considering future goals, aspirations, or shared plans.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h3><b>Factors contributing to commitment issues</b></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/is-your-ex-in-your-new-relationship/\"><b>Past romantic relationship</b></a><b> experiences</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Negative or traumatic experiences in past relationships, such as betrayal, abandonment, or heartbreak, may create emotional barriers and make it challenging to trust and fully commit in future relationships. </span></li>\n<li><b>Fear of vulnerability or intimacy</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Opening up and being emotionally vulnerable requires a level of </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/your-partner-doesnt-trust-you/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trust</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can be challenging for individuals who fear being hurt or rejected.</span></li>\n<li><b>Attachment styles</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Attachment styles developed in early childhood can influence how individuals approach and experience relationships. Avoidant attachment styles can be formed in situations where parents are consistently unavailable or unresponsive to a child’s needs. Those early experiences start a pattern of avoidance that continues into adulthood.</span></li>\n<li><b>Personal insecurities or low self-esteem</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: These individuals may doubt their own worthiness of love and worry about being inadequate in a relationship.</span></li>\n<li><b>Emotional trauma or unresolved issues</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: These unresolved issues may create emotional barriers that prevent deep connection and commitment.</span></li>\n<li><b>Mental health conditions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Certain mental health conditions, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), can contribute to commitment issues. The challenges associated with ADHD, such as impulsivity and difficulty with long-term planning, can make it harder for individuals to commit and maintain relationships<sup>1</sup>.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding these signs, symptoms, and contributing factors is essential in addressing and overcoming commitment issues. By recognizing and addressing the underlying causes, individuals can work towards developing healthier patterns of commitment and nurturing fulfilling relationships.</span></p>\n<h2><b>How Do You Know if You Have Commitment Issues? </b></h2>\n<h3><b>Self-reflection and introspection</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assessing your own commitment issues requires honest self-reflection and introspection. Take the time to delve into your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors surrounding commitment in relationships. Self-awareness is the first step towards understanding and addressing any challenges you may have. Reflect on your past relationships and see if you can spot any patterns or recurring themes that might suggest a reluctance or fear of commitment. Also, consider whether you experience anxiety or discomfort when faced with the idea of long-term commitment. This introspection can provide insights into the root causes of your commitment issues.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Dealing With Commitment Issues</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you decide you want to become more comfortable with commitment, there are a few things you can do to help achieve that:</span></p>\n<h3><b>1. Open and honest communication</b></h3>\n<p><b>Discussing fears and concerns with your partner</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/do-you-have-trouble-sharing-your-thoughts-and-feelings/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Openly communicate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your fears and concerns about commitment with your partner. If you know you don’t want to move forward with your current relationship, honestly sharing these thoughts and emotions with your partner will allow both of you to make the right decision for your relationship. </span></p>\n<p><b>Setting realistic expectations and boundaries</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Establish clear and realistic expectations and boundaries within your relationship. This helps create a sense of security and ensures that both partners are on the same page regarding the level of commitment and the pace of progress.</span></p>\n<h3><b>2. Gradual exposure to commitment</b></h3>\n<p><b>Taking small steps towards commitment</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This could involve committing to short-term goals or making incremental, manageable commitments within the relationship. </span></p>\n<p><b>Celebrating progress and acknowledging achievements</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Recognize and celebrate each milestone and achievement along the way. Acknowledge the progress you make, no matter how small, as it reinforces positive changes and motivates further growth.</span></p>\n<h3><b>3. Patience and understanding</b></h3>\n<p><b>Allowing time for personal growth and healing:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Becoming more comfortable with commitment is a journey that requires patience and understanding. Be patient with yourself and allow time for personal growth and healing. Recognize that change takes time and progress may come in stages. </span></p>\n<p><b>Being compassionate towards oneself and others</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Be understanding of your own struggles and extend the same empathy to your partner. It is also important to understand that full, long-term commitment may not always be the best option for you, depending on the situation. Don’t force yourself into commitment if you feel as though the relationship or circumstances aren’t right for you.</span></p>\n<h3><b>4. Seeking help</b></h3>\n<p><b>Relationship support programs</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Consider enrolling in a relationship support program specifically designed to address commitment issues. These programs provide a supportive and structured environment where you can explore the root causes of your commitment issues and learn strategies to overcome them. At </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/about/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OurRelationship</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, our self-driven program can help you and your partner explore and address the challenges in your relationship as well as learn better ways to communicate.</span></p>\n<p><b>Individual therapy or counseling</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Engaging in individual therapy or counseling can be immensely helpful in addressing commitment issues. A trained therapist can help you explore and understand the underlying factors contributing to your commitment struggles. Through personalized sessions, you can work on developing healthier patterns of thinking and behavior in relationships.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Supporting a Partner with Commitment Issues</b></h2>\n<h3><b>Recognizing and validating their feelings</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand that their fears and concerns are real and significant to them. Let them know that you respect their emotions and are there to support them. Remember that it may not be your job to change their mind, and that their unwillingness to commit may be the right choice for them and their circumstances.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Providing reassurance and support</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offer reassurance to your partner that you are committed to their well-being and the growth of the relationship. Show them through your words and actions that you are willing to work together to overcome their commitment issues. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Encouraging professional help if necessary</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your partner&#8217;s commitment issues are causing significant distress or hindering the relationship&#8217;s progress, gently suggest seeking professional help. Encourage them to explore individual therapy or couples counseling, where they can receive expert guidance and support in addressing their commitment challenges.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Addressing and overcoming commitment issues is crucial for fostering healthier and more fulfilling relationships. Unresolved commitment issues can hinder emotional intimacy, trust, and the overall growth of a partnership. By working through these challenges, individuals can develop the capacity for deeper connections, </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/5-things-you-can-do-to-protect-and-strengthen-your-relationship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long-lasting commitments</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and increased relationship satisfaction.

These stereotypes can create barriers and misunderstandings, impacting the well-being and dynamics of relationships. It is important to be resilient in the face of these stereotypes so that you can overcome the negative effects they can have on you and your relationships.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Understanding Stereotypes</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To effectively address and overcome these stereotypes, it is important to first understand their nature and the consequences they may have.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Definition of stereotypes and their impact on LGBTQ+ couples:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Stereotypes are fixed, oversimplified beliefs or assumptions about a particular group of people. When it comes to LGBTQ+ couples, stereotypes often sustain misconceptions and reinforce prejudice, creating more discrimination and social stigmatization for them.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Common stereotypes faced by LGBTQ+ individuals and couples:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   LGBTQ+ individuals and couples encounter various stereotypes that may arise from ignorance or ingrained biases. It can be hard to read about some of these; however, understanding these biased views can also help you recognize when you’re being viewed unfairly. Some prevalent stereotypes include:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>&#8220;The Promiscuous Lifestyle&#8221;</strong>: Assuming that LGBTQ+ couples engage in promiscuity or that their relationships lack commitment and stability. It is important to remember that LGBTQ+ relationships are as stable and enduring as heterosexual relationships, and that relationship challenges are not exclusive to any particular orientation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>&#8220;Gender Roles and Identity&#8221;</strong>: Presuming that there must be a strict adherence to traditional gender roles within LGBTQ+ relationships or assuming that one partner must exhibit more masculine or feminine traits. However, research shows that there is a lot of variability of gender roles and traits amongst both heterosexual and same-gender couples.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>&#8220;Influence on Children&#8221;</strong>: Misconceptions that LGBTQ+ couples are bad influences, unfit, or incapable of providing a nurturing environment for children. However, numerous scientific studies have shown that this is simply not true.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>&#8220;Phase or Choice&#8221;</strong>: Incorrectly perceiving being LGBTQ+ as a phase or a deliberate choice rather than a fundamental aspect of one&#8217;s identity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  &#8211; <strong>&#8220;Unnatural or abnormal&#8221;</strong>:  Thinking that it is somehow a mistake that not everybody is cisgender and heterosexual. However, in nature, life takes on diverse forms. It is natural to have variations, including in the realm of sexuality. For people who are gay, being attracted to people of the same gender is natural.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Negative effects of stereotypes on relationships and personal well-being:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, these stereotypes can have negative effects on LGBTQ+ individuals and their relationships. These effects include:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Increased stress and </strong></span><strong><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/is-anxiety-interfering-with-your-relationship-2/\">anxiety</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Navigating societal stereotypes can create emotional distress, impacting the mental health of individuals and couples.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Strained relationship dynamics</strong>: Stereotypes may result in </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/does-external-stress-cause-you-and-your-partner-to-fight/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">external pressures</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that challenge trust, communication, and mutual understanding within the relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Limited acceptance</strong>: Stereotypes can impede social acceptance, leading to feelings of isolation, rejection, and a lack of support from friends, family, or the larger community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can start the journey toward removing these harmful beliefs and fostering a more inclusive, accepting environment for all by recognizing and understanding the impact of stereotypes on LGBTQ+ couples.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Challenging Misunderstandings</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several things that can be done to combat these stereotypes:</span></p>\n<h3><b>Educating others about the diversity and complexity of LGBTQ+ experiences:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Sharing personal stories and experiences</strong>: Personal narratives humanize LGBTQ+ relationships, providing insight into the lived experiences and challenges faced.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Promoting LGBTQ+ representation</strong>: Advocating for positive and accurate representation in media, literature, and other platforms to showcase the diverse range of LGBTQ+ relationships.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Providing resources and information</strong>: Sharing educational resources, articles, and reputable organizations that provide accurate information about LGBTQ+ relationships.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Encouraging empathy and understanding to foster healthy relationships:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Developing empathy and understanding is essential for creating a supportive environment. Here&#8217;s how we can promote empathy:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Listening actively</strong>: Encourage open and non-judgmental communication, allowing your partner to share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences without fear of rejection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Seeking common ground</strong>: Focus on shared values, emotions, and experiences to bridge gaps and build empathy, emphasizing that love and the desire for meaningful relationships are universal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Promoting </strong></span><strong><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/7-steps-to-understanding-the-importance-of-communication-in-a-relationship/\">communication</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> and learning</strong>: Encourage open-minded conversations, respectful questions, and a desire to learn from one another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; <strong>Non-defensive responses</strong>: Respond with empathy and curiosity rather than defensiveness, fostering an atmosphere of understanding and acceptance.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Emphasizing the importance of open communication within LGBTQ+ relationships:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Building trust</strong>: Honest and transparent communication builds a foundation of trust, allowing you to feel secure and understood in the relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Expressing needs and concerns</strong>: Open dialogue allows partners to express their needs, desires, and concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Strengthening connection</strong>: Engaging in meaningful conversations helps partners deepen their emotional bond, creating a stronger sense of intimacy and connection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you would like to learn more on how to talk about the status and future of your relationship, click </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-talk-about-the-status-and-future-of-your-relationship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Building a Supportive Network</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By cultivating relationships with supportive friends, family, and allies, surrounding yourself with positive influences and role models, and celebrating LGBTQ+ identities, we can foster a sense of community and create an environment of love, acceptance, and understanding.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Cultivating a network of supportive friends, family, and allies:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Open communication</strong>: Engage in honest conversations with friends, family, and allies about your experiences and needs, creating opportunities for understanding and support.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Setting boundaries</strong>: Establish boundaries with individuals who may not be accepting or supportive, focusing on nurturing relationships with those who demonstrate empathy and respect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you would like to learn tips on raising a child in a same-gender household, click </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/raising-a-child-in-a-same-sex-household-parenting-tips-for-lgbtq-couples/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Surrounding yourself with positive influences and role models:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Engage with LGBTQ+ media</strong>: Educate yourself on LGBTQ+ literature, movies, music, and other media that promote positive representations and diverse narratives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Follow LGBTQ+ advocates</strong>: Seek out LGBTQ+ activists, influencers, and role models who inspire and uplift the community, promoting self-acceptance and pride.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   &#8211; <strong>Engage in LGBTQ+ events</strong>: Consider attending LGBTQ+ pride parades, community gatherings, and other events that celebrate identities and foster a sense of belonging.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, your journey is unique and deserving of understanding and respect.

It often requires patience, understanding, and support as your partner navigates their journey of self-discovery and acceptance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the key challenges is the need for secrecy and discretion. Keeping your relationship hidden from others can place a </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/signs-that-stress-is-affecting-your-relationship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">significant emotional burden on both of you</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It may leave you feeling exhausted, and it can also lead to feelings of frustration, isolation, and even self-doubt. Furthermore, you may wonder if your partner will eventually come out, how their coming out process will unfold, and what it means for your relationship. Remember that these thoughts and emotions are normal and valid, and that finding healthy ways to cope may be important in order for you to provide the support and patience your partner will need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it can be challenging, your partner&#8217;s decision to remain in the closet is deeply personal and should be respected. It&#8217;s not your role to push or pressure them into coming out before they are ready. Instead, focus on providing a safe and supportive space where they feel comfortable exploring their identity at their own pace. In this article, we will explore how you can be a pillar of strength for your partner as they navigate the coming out process.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Common Fears and Concerns Your Partner Might Have About Coming Out</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coming out process can be accompanied by a range of fears and concerns for your partner. Some common worries may include the fear of rejection, judgment, and potential damage to existing relationships.

Empathy allows you to understand and share in their experiences, validating their emotions and journey. Respect involves honoring their autonomy and choices, allowing them to come out at their own pace and in their own way. Patience is essential as your partner navigates the challenges and emotions associated with coming out. Recognize that this process is unique to them and may require time and support.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Creating a Safe and Trusting Environment</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some tips for creating a safe space where your partner can express themselves without judgment:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> Practice active listening</strong>: Listen attentively and without interruption.

Try to avoid making assumptions or passing judgment on their experiences.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> Validate their emotions</strong>: Let your partner know that their emotions are valid and understandable. Recognize their experiences by acknowledging their feelings without dismissing or minimizing them.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> Encourage self-expression</strong>: Encourage your partner to express themselves authentically, free from fear of judgment. Celebrate their individuality and uniqueness, fostering an environment that embraces diversity.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h4><b>Express your support by:</b></h4>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> Using affirming language</strong>: Validate their feelings by using statements such as &#8220;I understand why you might feel that way&#8221; or &#8220;Your experiences are valid, and I&#8217;m here for you.&#8221;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> Celebrating their courage</strong>: Recognize the bravery and strength it takes for them to share their true selves. Commend their courage and remind them of your unwavering support.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For other tips on communication within your relationship, click </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/do-you-have-trouble-sharing-your-thoughts-and-feelings/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Educating Yourself about LGBTQ+ Issues and Experiences</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you consider yourself a member of the LGBTQ+ community or not, it is important to take the initiative and learn about the challenges and triumphs those in the community face.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Familiarize yourself with appropriate terms such as gender identity, sexual orientation, and non-binary, among others. This knowledge will enable you to engage in meaningful conversations with your partner and others within the LGBTQ+ community. </span><a href=\"https://pflag.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PFLAG</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an organization that offers an abundance of valuable information and resources on LGBTQ+ topics.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Suggest Resources such as Books, Articles, or Support Groups</b></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Books: Recommend your partner LGBTQ+ literature that explores various topics and experiences. Some notable titles include &#8220;Stone Butch Blues&#8221; by Leslie Feinberg, &#8220;Redefining Realness&#8221; by Janet Mock, and &#8220;The Velvet Rage&#8221; by Alan Downs.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Articles: Share articles from reputable sources that cover LGBTQ+ topics, including personal narratives, educational pieces, and current events. Online platforms like LGBTQ+-focused websites, blogs, and news outlets can provide valuable insights.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Support Groups: Encourage your partner to seek support from LGBTQ+ community centers or local support groups. These spaces offer a sense of belonging and can provide both of you with opportunities to connect with others who have similar experiences. Some examples of good LGBTQ+ communities are </span><a href=\"https://pflag.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PFLAG</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as previously mentioned, which would be ideal for adults, and </span><a href=\"https://www.thetrevorproject.org/visit-trevorspace/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Trevor Project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for teens and young adults.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><b>Address Practical Aspects of Coming Out, Such as Informing Family, Friends, and Colleagues</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming out involves practical considerations, such as informing family, friends, and colleagues about your partner&#8217;s LGBTQ+ identity. Discuss the importance of these conversations and the potential impact they may have on your partner&#8217;s relationships and support network. Acknowledge the significance of the steps involved in coming out.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Suggest Ways to Offer Assistance and Support During These Conversations</b></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Offer to be present: Ask your partner if they would like you to be present during their coming out conversations. Your presence can provide them with emotional support and a sense of security during potentially challenging discussions.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Practice role-playing: Help your partner prepare for these conversations by role-playing different scenarios. This can boost their confidence and allow them to anticipate and navigate potential reactions or questions.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h3><b>Respect Your Partner&#8217;s Pace and Decisions</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Respecting your partner&#8217;s pace and decisions is paramount during the practical aspects of coming out. Each person&#8217;s journey is unique, and they may choose to come out to different people at different times. Encourage your partner to set their own boundaries and determine the right moment for these conversations. Support their decisions and avoid pressuring or rushing them.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporting your partner during their coming out journey is significant for maintaining a healthy and thriving relationship. By demonstrating empathy, respect, and patience, you can create a safe space where they feel </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/why-love-matters/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loved</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, accepted, and understood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find that the problems in your relationship persist or become overwhelming, consider seeking a relationship support program specifically designed for LGBTQ+ couples.

As more couples are able to start families, access to guidance and assistance is becoming more important. In this article, we will explore parenting tips specifically tailored to LGBTQ+ couples, to empower them in their role as loving and nurturing parents.</span></p>\n<p>Parenting in a LGBTQ+ household comes with its own set of joys and challenges. For instance, the LGBTQ+ community and its members have many strengths and resources that can be harnessed to create a special nurturing, inclusive, and resilient environment for children. By raising awareness of these unique aspects, we can help prepare parents to create a nurturing and inclusive environment. For more information on effective strategies to strengthen your relationship click <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/5-things-you-can-do-to-protect-and-strengthen-your-relationship/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Support for Parenting</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Building a Support Network</strong></h3>\n<p>Even in the most supportive of environments, parenting is one of the most difficult and all-encompassing tasks you will ever undertake. Unfortunately, many LGBTQ+ parents are raising a child in an environment that is anything but supportive – adding to the stress, to the frustrations, and self-doubt that parenthood can involve. Therefore, it’s important that you and your partner build a supportive network of other parents.</p>\n<h4><strong>1. Connecting with other LGBTQ+ families and support groups:</strong></h4>\n<p>&#8211; Seek out LGBTQ+ parenting groups or meetups in your local community.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Attend events or conferences focused on LGBTQ+ families to connect with like-minded individuals.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Engage in online communities and forums dedicated to supporting LGBTQ+ parents.</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Seeking out resources and organizations that provide guidance and assistance:</strong></h4>\n<p>&#8211; Research local LGBTQ+ community centers or organizations that offer family support services.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Explore online platforms that provide resources specifically designed for LGBTQ+ parents.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Consider attending workshops or classes that focus on parenting skills and techniques for LGBTQ+ couples.</p>\n<h2><strong>Nurturing Your Child’s Emotional Well-being</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Creating an Inclusive Home</strong></h3>\n<p>In any household, creating an inclusive home environment is essential for your child&#8217;s well-being and development. Here are some tips to establish an open and accepting atmosphere in a LGBTQ+ household:</p>\n<h4><strong>1. Establishing an open and accepting atmosphere:</strong></h4>\n<p>&#8211; Emphasize the importance of love, respect, and acceptance within your family.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Celebrate and honor each family member&#8217;s unique identities and contributions. <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/can-family-background-affect-your-relationships/\">This article</a> provides more guidance on how family backgrounds may affect your relationship.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Discuss the significance of diversity and teach children to appreciate and value differences.</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Encouraging open communication about diversity and inclusion</strong></h4>\n<p>The LGBTQ+ community embraces individuals who identify beyond the conventional norms of gender and sexuality. Despite ongoing internal differences and discussions, the community as a whole is remarkably varied, accepting, and open to all. Being able to say that you are a part of a community that takes others where the rest of the world has failed is no small accomplishment. This background often makes LGBTQ+ parents well-qualified to talk to their children regarding the importance of diversity and inclusion:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Initiate age-appropriate conversations about different family structures and identities.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Answer your child&#8217;s questions honestly and openly, fostering a safe space for discussion.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Provide age-appropriate books, movies, and resources that promote diversity and inclusion.</p>\n<p>Find out the value of communication in <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/7-steps-to-understanding-the-importance-of-communication-in-a-relationship/\">these 7 steps</a>.</p>\n<h4><strong>3. Highlighting LGBTQ+ historical figures and their contributions:</strong></h4>\n<p>Unfortunately, your child may be exposed to negative stereotypes of the LGBTQ+ community growing up. From an early age, they may be asked about having “two mommies” or “two daddies”. To counteract the negativity, let them know about the strengths of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Introduce your child to LGBTQ+ historical figures who have made significant contributions in various fields.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Share stories and biographies that highlight their achievements, promoting a sense of pride and inspiration.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Discuss the challenges these individuals faced and how they overcame adversity, fostering resilience and determination.</p>\n<h3><strong>Promoting Self-Acceptance</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>1. Fostering self-esteem and confidence:</strong></h4>\n<p>&#8211; Provide positive affirmations and reinforce their strengths and abilities.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Encourage them to set achievable goals and celebrate their accomplishments.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Create a safe environment for open and honest communication, where they feel comfortable expressing their feelings and thoughts. For more counsel on how to share and express feelings, please click <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/do-you-have-trouble-sharing-your-thoughts-and-feelings/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Equipping children with tools to handle discrimination:</strong></h4>\n<p>&#8211; Without too much fear or mistrust, teach them about different forms of discrimination and prejudice that may exist in society.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Help them develop effective communication skills to respond to ignorance or negative remarks.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Encourage assertiveness and teach them when they should seek support from trusted adults or authorities.</p>\n<h4><strong>3. Teaching empathy and resilience:</strong></h4>\n<p>&#8211; Foster empathy by encouraging your child to understand and appreciate diverse perspectives.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Teach them how to respond to bullying or prejudice with kindness and understanding.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Promote resilience by emphasizing their inner strength and supporting them during challenging times.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Sharing support, guidance, and resources for LGBTQ+ couples raising children empowers them in creating a nurturing environment where their children can flourish.</p>\n<p>As you continue your journey as queer parents, remember to explore further resources and support options available to you.

However, it’s important to recognize that the journey of reintegration may present its own set of challenges.  Luckily, with patience, understanding, and a commitment to each other, you can navigate the post-deployment period with grace and strengthen the love you share. In the sections that follow, we&#8217;ll go over practical tips and strategies to help you along the way.</span></p>\n<h2><b>The Reintegration Process</b></h2>\n<h3><b>Understanding the Stages of Reintegration after Deployment</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reintegrating with your partner after a military deployment or TDY involves navigating through various stages. Recognizing and understanding these stages can help both partners manage expectations and emotions effectively.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Initial Reunion and Excitement:</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   The initial reunion is often filled with excitement, joy, and relief. It&#8217;s a time to celebrate being together again and catch up on missed moments. Emotions may be intense during this stage, as you both try to reconnect and adjust to being physically close again.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Disillusionment and Adjustment:</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   After the initial excitement settles, it&#8217;s common to experience a period of disillusionment and adjustment. It may feel as though reality is setting in, and you both may face challenges in readjusting to daily routines, roles, and responsibilities. It&#8217;s important to be patient and understanding during this phase, as it may take time to find a new rhythm as a couple.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Rebuilding and Reconnecting:</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   The rebuilding stage is where you focus on reconnecting emotionally and rebuilding the relationship. It involves </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-balance-spending-time-together-in-your-relationship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actively working</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on communication, trust, and intimacy. This stage offers an opportunity to rediscover shared interests, create new memories, and strengthen the bond that was temporarily disrupted by deployment or TDY.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Welcoming Your Partner Home</b></h2>\n<h4><b style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Creating a Warm and Welcoming Environment:</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Before your partner&#8217;s arrival, take the time to create a warm and inviting space. Consider cleaning and/or decorating your home to make it feel cozy and comfortable. You could add personal touches such as photos, mementos, or their favorite things to help them feel appreciated and welcome.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Involving Family and Friends in the Celebration:</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   If you think your partner would appreciate and enjoy it, a homecoming celebration is a wonderful opportunity to involve family and friends in welcoming your partner back. Coordinate with loved ones to plan a gathering or surprise event that expresses love, support, and excitement. This collective celebration can help create an atmosphere of joy and make the homecoming even more memorable.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Making the Transition Smooth</b></h3>\n<h4><b style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Allowing Time for Readjustment and Rest:</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Understand that your partner may need time to readjust to daily life after deployment or TDY. Be mindful of their need for rest and relaxation. Give them space to decompress, allowing them to set their own pace for reintegration. This will help ease the transition and reduce feelings of overwhelm.</span></p>\n<p><b>Showing Patience and Understanding:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Recognize that both you and your partner may have changed during the time apart. Be patient with each other as you adapt to new routines and roles. Understand that readjustment can bring challenges and occasional misunderstandings. Approach these situations with empathy, actively listening to each other&#8217;s perspectives, and offering understanding and </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/ways-to-get-and-give-emotional-support-in-your-relationship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Expressing Gratitude and Appreciation</b></h3>\n<h3><b style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Acknowledging the Sacrifices Made during Deployment:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Take time to express your gratitude for the sacrifices your partner made during deployment or TDY. Let them know how much you appreciate their dedication, courage, and commitment to their service. Acknowledge the challenges they faced and the strength they demonstrated throughout the deployment.</span></p>\n<p><b>Offering Gestures of Love and Support:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Show your love and support through meaningful gestures. These can include simple acts of kindness, such as preparing their favorite meal, organizing a relaxing day together, or writing a heartfelt letter expressing your love and pride. Small gestures can go a long way in reaffirming your bond and making your partner feel valued and cherished. You can find information on the importance of gestures such as date nights </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/the-importance-of-date-night/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Addressing the Emotional and Psychological Aspects of Reintegration</b></h3>\n<h3><b style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Coping with Mixed Emotions and Expectations:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Both partners may experience a mix of emotions during reintegration. You both may also have different expectations of what reintegration will be like. It&#8217;s common to feel joy, relief, anxiety, or even a sense of sadness. Recognize that these emotions are normal and allow space for each other to express and process them. Additionally, managing expectations is crucial, as the realities of post-deployment life may differ from what was imagined during the separation.</span></p>\n<p><b>Recognizing Potential Changes in Both Partners:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  The time and different experiences you both had while separated can change you in various ways. It&#8217;s important to acknowledge and understand that both of you may have undergone personal growth, faced challenges, or developed new perspectives during the time apart. Embrace these changes and approach your partner with openness and curiosity. Take the time to learn about each other&#8217;s experiences and support one another through the process of adjustment.</span></p>\n<p><b>Communicating Openly and Honestly about Feelings and Experiences:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">   Effective </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-talk-about-the-status-and-future-of-your-relationship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">communication</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is key to successful reintegration. Create a safe and non-judgmental space for open and honest conversations about feelings, experiences, and expectations. Active listening, empathy, and validation are essential during this phase. Share your thoughts, concerns, and aspirations, and encourage your partner to do the same. This kind of communication fosters understanding, strengthens emotional bonds, and paves the way for a more connected relationship.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><b>Finding Support:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you find that the problems in your relationship persist or become overwhelming, consider seeking a relationship support program specifically designed for military couples. The OurRelationship program offers a free, online program for both </span><a href=\"https://military.ourrelationship.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">active-duty/Guard/Reserve</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"http://www.ourrelationship.com/military-couples\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veteran</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> couples to explore and address the challenges in your relationships.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By recognizing the stages of reintegration and addressing the emotional and psychological aspects involved, you and your partner can navigate the post-deployment phase with greater understanding and resilience. Remember, reconnection takes time, effort, and patience, but by working together, you can build a stronger and more fulfilling relationship.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To all military couples, we want to offer words of encouragement and support. We understand the unique challenges you face and the sacrifices you make for your country and each other. Remember that you are not alone in your journey. Reach out to your support network (whether it&#8217;s friends, family, or fellow military couples) for understanding and empathy. Seek solace in knowing that many couples have successfully navigated the challenges of deployment and reintegration, and you can too. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Learn More about How to Improve Your Relationship!</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\"><b>www.ourrelationship.com</b></a></p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p><strong>by Jackson Weiser</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We often get various questions about dating military men. Whether you just started dating a military man or you’ve been together for some time, we hope to provide some clarity to questions we receive about dating someone in the military.</span></p>\n<h3><b>“What do military guys look for in a girl?”</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Military guys, just like anyone else, look for someone they can connect with emotionally, intellectually, and physically. They value qualities such as loyalty, understanding, and flexibility in their partners.</span></p>\n<h3><b>“Why are military guys so clingy?”</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Military life can be unpredictable, and deployments and separations can make couples feel like they&#8217;re constantly in a state of transition. This can make military guys feel more clingy or needy than usual, as they crave the stability and comfort of a relationship during challenging times.</span></p>\n<h3><b>“Why do military guys move fast in relationships?”</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Military life is fast-paced and full of change. When a military man meets someone they connect with, they may feel like they need to move quickly because they don’t know when their circumstances might change.</span></p>\n<h3><b>“Why do military guys fall in love so fast?”</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly to moving fast in relationships, military guys may fall in love quickly because they want to make the most of their time with their partner. The threat of deployment or separation can make them feel like they need to act quickly to solidify their relationship.</span></p>\n<h3><b>“Why does my military boyfriend seem emotionless?”</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you are dating a veteran or someone who is currently in the military, PTSD can manifest itself in a seemingly emotionless outward appearance. Unfortunately, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">many veterans and servicemen suffer from PTSD, so they might have difficulty expressing positive emotions as a result of re-experiencing traumatic states.<sup>1</sup></span></p>\n<h3><b>“Are military guys faithful?”</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like with any other group of people, there are both faithful and unfaithful individuals among military guys. It&#8217;s unfair to generalize an entire group based on the actions of a few. However, military life can be stressful and challenging, which can sometimes put a strain on relationships. It&#8217;s important to have open and honest communication with your partner about your expectations and boundaries.</span></p>\n<h3><b>“How do I know if a military guy likes me?”</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few signs that a military guy may be interested in you. He may make an effort to spend time with you, initiate conversations, and ask you questions about yourself. He may also show concern for your well-being and try to make you feel comfortable and supported. It’s important to remember, however, that not everyone shows their interest in the same way. Some military men might be more reserved or shy. Therefore, if you’re unsure about how someone feels about you, the best thing to do would be to ask them directly. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Learn More about How to Improve Your Relationship!</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\"><b>www.ourrelationship.com</b></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">References</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Litz, B.

      "rendered": "<p><b>by Jackson Weiser</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike other long-distance relationships, dating an individual in the military can bring up a host of unique challenges. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deployments, temporary duty assignments (TDY), different time zones, and limited communication can all make military relationships challenging. However, it is possible for your relationship to survive and even thrive under these circumstances. By following the tips in this article, you can make the most out of your long-distance military relationship.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Communication is Key</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long-distance military relationships require extra effort in order to stay connected and maintain a strong relationship. That&#8217;s why communication is absolutely key! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regular communication is essential for </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-promote-intimacy-with-communication/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">building trust and intimacy in your relationship</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is especially true when you can&#8217;t physically be together. It is important to actively listen during your conversations, and be honest about how you feel and what’s on your mind, even if it isn’t pleasant. This also means being patient and understanding when communication isn&#8217;t always easy, whether due to time differences, technical difficulties, or other factors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, try to make communication a top priority in your long-distance military relationship. Use a variety of communication methods, such as texting, calling, or video calls to keep things interesting and mix it up. Maintaining consistent communication may take extra effort, but it&#8217;s worth it to maintain a strong, healthy relationship despite the miles between you. If you or your partner has trouble expressing their thoughts and feelings, </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/do-you-have-trouble-sharing-your-thoughts-and-feelings/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a link to another one of our articles that can help you with that.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Embrace Your Independence</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are aware that having a long-distance military relationship can be challenging, but it can also be a chance for personal development. When your companion is gone, you have more time to concentrate on yourself, explore your own interests and hobbies, and solidify your own identity. Embracing your freedom and making the most of your alone time are as essential as staying in touch and making time for your relationship. Here are some examples of what you can do:</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Get involved in your community </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if your partner isn’t away, it is always a good idea to get involved in your community. Whether it be volunteering, taking classes, or playing sports, there are many ways to feel connected with the people around you and gain fulfillment without the presence of your partner. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Hone a skill</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making steady progress on a skill is one of the best ways to feel accomplished and independent. As you see yourself getting better and better, you will feel more confident in other parts of your life as well. You could even surprise your partner with your new talent when they return. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Go on a solo adventure</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traveling by yourself is another great way to embrace your time alone. You don’t need to go far, either. Simply going across town can be a refreshing experience. If you’ve never traveled alone before, you might be pleasantly surprised by the fact that you can do it completely at your own pace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Embracing your independence also takes some of the pressure off your partner, who may feel guilty or stressed about being away from you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, it&#8217;s important to find the right balance between independence and couple time. You don&#8217;t want to become so focused on your own interests that you neglect your relationship altogether. But by becoming a more independent person, you develop a healthier, more balanced relationship with your partner overseas.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Plan for the Future</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest challenges of a long-distance military relationship is the uncertainty about the future. With deployments, training, and relocations, it can be hard to know what&#8217;s coming next and how to plan for it. But having a plan, both short-term and long-term, can help you and your partner </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-talk-about-the-status-and-future-of-your-relationship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feel more secure and confident about your future together</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Short-term plans </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This might include things like scheduling regular visits, setting aside time for video chats and phone calls, and planning special events or surprises for each other. These can help keep the relationship feeling fresh and exciting, even when you aren’t physically together.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Long-term plans </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This might include things like discussing where you want to live when your partner is done with their deployment or TDY, talking about career goals and aspirations, and considering how you might build a life together once the deployment or TDY is over. Having a shared vision for the future can give you both something to work towards, and can help you weather the ups and downs that might occur along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, sit down with your partner and have an honest conversation about your goals and aspirations, both individually and as a couple. Brainstorm ways to make those goals a reality, and make a plan for how you&#8217;ll work towards them together. Even if the plan changes along the way, having a shared vision for the future can help keep your relationship strong and thriving despite the distance.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Keep the Romance Alive</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being in a long-distance military relationship doesn&#8217;t mean that the romance has to fizzle out. With a little effort and creativity, you can keep the spark alive and make your partner feel loved and appreciated, </span><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-stay-intimate-connected-in-a-long-distance-relationship/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even when you&#8217;re miles apart</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Here are some ideas to get you started:</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Surprise Visits</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing says &#8220;I love you&#8221; like a surprise visit from your partner. If you&#8217;re able to plan a visit, try to keep it a secret until the last minute for an extra element of surprise. Even if you can only visit for a short time, the gesture can go a long way in making your partner feel special.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Virtual Dates</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to technology, there are plenty of ways to have a &#8220;date&#8221; with your partner even when you&#8217;re not in the same room. Plan a virtual dinner date, movie night, or game night using video chat or screen sharing. You can even send each other food or snacks to enjoy together during the date.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Love Letters</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a world of instant messaging and texting, there&#8217;s something especially romantic about a handwritten love letter. Take the time to write down your feelings and send a physical letter or care package to your partner. It&#8217;s a tangible reminder of your love that they can hold onto and cherish.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, the key to keeping the romance alive in a long-distance military relationship is to stay intentional and make the effort to show your partner that you really care and are thinking about them. By planning surprise visits, virtual dates, and sending love letters, you can keep the spark alive and show your partner that distance doesn&#8217;t diminish your love.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Acknowledge the Unique Challenges and Rewards</b></h2>\n<h3><strong>The Challenges </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These might include frequent moves, deployments, and the stress and anxiety that come with military life. It can be difficult to maintain a sense of stability and routine when your partner&#8217;s job requires them to be away from home and potentially in danger for extended periods of time.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>The Rewards</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also unique rewards to being in a military relationship. For example, you and your partner are both part of a larger community that values service, sacrifice, and patriotism. This means that they understand your feelings and worries, so they are well equipped to offer support and empathy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another positive of the military relationship is that you may have the opportunity to travel and experience different parts of the country or the world. You also get to be a part of your partner&#8217;s journey as they grow and develop in their military career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acknowledging the challenges and rewards of military life can help you and your partner maintain perspective and find ways to support each other through the ups and downs. It&#8217;s important to be open and honest about your feelings and experiences, and to actively work together to navigate the unique challenges of military life. Celebrate the unique aspects of your partnership while also finding ways to support each other through the tough times.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By following these tips and finding creative ways to support each other, you can overcome the unique challenges of a long-distance military relationship and build a strong and lasting partnership. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn More about How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p><strong>by Myrtle Valpoort</strong></p>\n<p>Couples may begin their journey of parenthood believing a baby will bring them closer. In reality, the quality of a relationship tends to decline after the birth of a firstborn.<sup>1 </sup>Childcare introduces a variety of new challenges and stressors that can test a relationship. . Mothers tend to report declines in relationship confidence and conflict management after birth. Mothers and fathers often report a decline in relationship dedication after birth.<sup>3 </sup>Fortunately, there are steps that can prepare your relationship for this stressful yet exciting time. In order to reduce conflict and maintain closeness during the transition to parenthood, consider the following tips.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Both partners should actively prepare for the baby</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Prospective parents are encouraged to seek as much information as possible about their new journey. Prenatal classes, books, and support groups can each provide valuable information and support to new parents. However, mothers typically engage in prenatal education more than fathers in heterosexual relationships. Fathers can seek information on their own or attend classes with their partners. Online resources are a great, accessible way to seek help from psychologists and other parents. A great first step is the CDC’s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/index.html\">positive parenting site</a> which offers advice for each developmental stage in your new baby’s life. Another alternative is for couples to attend prenatal classes together. Finally, you can contact a midwife to serve as a trustworthy and comforting source of information.<sup>2</sup> All of the above can support parents and even help them stay united during this transition. This is important because it can positively affect overall relationship satisfaction, which can increase as both parents begin to feel more confident in their role.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Find ways that both partners can be involved. </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Similar to the preparation phase, a lot of responsibilities and baby needs are assigned to the mother in heterosexual relationships. <sup>2</sup> However, the other parent can support both their partner and baby through housework and other forms of assistance. Keeping the home tidy, making meals, and taking care of pets are great ways to show support. These responsibilities can be overwhelming but making an effort is crucial. Before the baby arrives, you and your partner should discuss possible chores and create a plan to divide and conquer. Later, check in with one another and reassess your assigned tasks. The less involved partner can connect with the newborn by taking over some baby-related duties while their partner is resting. Possible chores include changing, bathing, dressing, and bottle-feeding the baby. By taking on some of the workload, less involved partners can connect with the baby while lifting some stress off the more involved partner.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Establish a strong support system</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Learning from both mistakes and successes of others can ease the difficult transition to parenthood. After the birth of a new baby, couples often look to their support systems for guidance. Grandparents can be a great resource if you trust their perspective and parenting philosophy. You can also find local or virtual parenting groups through Facebook or Reddit for advice and support. Building a support network is crucial for feeling informed, confident, and emotionally supported.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Plan for post-birth changes </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>With a new baby, you will experience changes in many areas. There will be a need to expand in some and cut back in others; through these changes it is important to nurture your romantic relationship. You should expect your relationship to require more work but discussing change beforehand can be helpful. Time and time again, new parents are shocked by how much relationships change after having a child – many wished they had been more prepared.<sup>2 </sup>You and your partner will also change as individuals as you work to overcome new obstacles. Being a parent is not an easy task and many people have difficulty adjusting. It is common for couples to experience <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/is-anxiety-interfering-with-your-relationship-2/\">mental health</a> troubles after having a child.<sup>4</sup> Of course, this is difficult to predict, but being aware of possible troubles and preparing accordingly can be beneficial.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Find time to connect </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The health of your relationship with your partner is important for more than your own well-being. Dysfunctional relationships also may impact the well-being of the baby. In fact, babies tend to cry more when their parents’ relationship is characterized by dissatisfaction and <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/why-do-couples-fight/\">conflict</a>.<sup>5 </sup>The best way to combat this is by making time for one another. It might not be as easy as before but setting time aside and prioritizing each other will be worth it – especially if you are committed to having a loving and supportive relationship for years to come. If you are already experiencing tension, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-promote-intimacy-with-communication/\">constructively voicing issues</a> is the first step towards improving relationship satisfaction. I encourage you to lean into difficult conversations. It is an essential skill to build as a new parent.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>New information can be overwhelming but discussing ways to implement a few tips with your partner is a great step. Just remember to be patient and kind to yourself and your partner as you embark on this beautiful journey together.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn More about How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Carlson, M.

      "rendered": "<p><strong>by Melanie Verschoore</strong></p>\n<p>Do you feel as if the sexual excitement with your partner is beginning to fizzle out?  Perhaps you feel panicked because you’re unaware of why you’re no longer in the mood to jump your partner’s bones 24/7, or vice versa – does this mean you’ve lost your connection to one another? Don’t be alarmed just yet, because it’s extremely common for both married and unmarried couples to experience such sexual troubles. It’s not always clear what factors could be contributing to your seemingly stagnant and/or unfulfilling sex life with your partner. Whether due to mental health problems, communication discrepancies, or familiarity with one another, there could be a number of different culprits negatively affecting your partner’s sexual relationship. One important thing to keep in mind is that <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/is-sex-important-in-your-relationship/\">declines in sexual activity</a> happen naturally as relationships progress. In fact, there is often a steep drop in sexual frequency after the second year of a relationship<sup>1</sup>. It’s difficult to maintain high sexual desire over the course of a relationship<sup>2</sup>. However, even if you feel discouraged that one or both of you don’t have the same proclivity for sex you once did, you can still turn things around. Here are four tips to help you recognize and address what may be causing changes in your sex life, as well as how to manage and <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/top-3-reasons-to-have-more-sex/\">revitalize your bond</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. Try new things together – in the bedroom and beyond</strong></h2>\n<p>In the beginning of relationships, passion and energy are at an all-time high. We constantly think and fantasize about our partner, want to spend time with them, and usually have a lot of sex.  However, as romantic relationships progress, we can easily become accustomed to our activities with our partner and, unfortunately, this can include sex. Sometimes couples are faced with sexual discrepancies, where one partner wants sex more or less than the other<sup>3</sup>. In such situations, attempting to fix the problem is often worth the effort<sup>3</sup>. This usually requires communicating about the issue. Another helpful strategy is to explore the potential kinks and fantasies of the partner who tends express their desires less. Although focusing on <em>sexual</em> behaviors that you can try out with your partner is important, your exciting activities together don’t always have to be centered around sex. Self-expansion theory is the idea that doing novel activities with your partner can ignite exhilaration and passion in your relationship<sup>2</sup>. This passion is can be reminiscent of the “falling in love stage” that people often crave when they notice a plateau forming in their relationship. Trying out some fun activities with your partner that you don’t typically do can help you incorporate this in your day-to-day life. This can include taking a pottery class together, visiting a museum, and more – just try out something new! Physical activities are another great way to incite passion in the relationship as well. The Two-Factor theory suggests that if you are physiologically aroused during an activity, you will attribute that arousal to the person you’re with. Hiking or going to concerts with your partner are just a couple great ways to get the adrenaline pumping and awaken your desires.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Reflect on your personal views about sex – and yourself</strong></h2>\n<p>Your internal and external views about both sex and your overall body image can affect how you approach sex in your personal relationship. For instance, how you view yourself has a large impact on your sexual performance with a partner. Relationship functioning  tends to suffer when they are highly self-conscious about their bodies, and in turn causes them to have less pleasure/enjoyment during sexual activity<sup>4</sup>. Not only can body image issues lead people to avoid certain sexual activities all together, but it can also lead people to be distracted during sex<sup>4</sup>. When we are unable to fully focus on sex in the moment, it’s not as satisfying and may cause us to have a decreased desire for sex. Reflect on both your attitudes toward sex, as well as your personal relationship with your body and self-esteem. It’s important for you to communicate with your partner about your insecurities – whether about yourself or your sexual performance – so that they may support you and so you can move forward as a couple.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. Ask about your partner’s mental wellbeing</strong></h2>\n<p>You’d be surprised at how easily people can forget to inquire about the “simple things” with their partner, such as how their day was or if they ate, when comfortable in the relationship. Sometimes we get caught up in the hectic whirlwind of our own lives and fail to see the internal struggles our partner is facing, especially if they aren’t forthcoming about their emotions. Sexual difficulties are associated with <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/is-anxiety-interfering-with-your-relationship-2/\">poor mental health</a><sup>5</sup>; if you’re witnessing unknown changes in your sex life, it could be related to mental health struggles. This highlights the importance of frequent and honest communication, even about topics that aren’t the easiest to bring up. If you are unsure of how to approach your partner about this, just remember to be calm and honest. Communicate with your partner ways that they can support you in your struggles and incorporate them in your plans to look after your mental health. Maybe you could decide to check in with each other once a week to really assess how the two of you are feeling mentally/emotionally; just setting an intention can be extremely beneficial.</p>\n<h2><strong>4. Don’t be afraid to have conversations about sex</strong></h2>\n<p>We know that open and transparent communication with a partner is crucial to both relationship functioning and sexual functioning, and sexual communication is no exception. Sex talk can be <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-understanding-healthy-sex-can-help-you-have-a-happier-relationship/\">uncomfortable</a> for a lot of people, so it’s no wonder that it’s not always easy to talk about with your partner. However, even if they may seem intimidating at first, having intimate conversations with your partner can be immensely beneficial. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/reigniting-the-fire-how-to-talk-about-sex-with-your-partner/\">sexual communication</a> is associated with relationship satisfaction<sup>6</sup>. This makes sense because if one partner is not communicating their sexual needs or desires to the other, the latter is likely to continue their unsatisfactory behavior. It’s important to talk about sex with your partner to ensure that you are aware of what you both like and don’t like and so that you can talk about sex more transparently in the future. Asking your partner first what they like or are interested in can lift some weight off your shoulders and, in turn, make it easier for you to then bring up your own interests/desires. Try to be honest and authentic, but also be sure to use positive language to avoid hurting their feelings and risk distancing your partner . Sex is a touchy subject, so you want to make sure you are sensitive to your partner’s feelings. It can create positive changes in your sex life when you and your partner talk about what you both want; it shows that you care about your partner’s happiness and satisfaction, while also helping to improve sex all together.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Being comfortable in communicating with your partner about your sexuality and mental well-being can improve sex life and relationship as a whole. Don’t be worried if the spark doesn’t feel as strong as it did in the beginning of your relationship – it’s natural, and there are still ways for you and your partner to work through this. Reflect on the status of your sex life with your partner– could any of the topics mentioned above be influencing aspects of your relationship? Try out a couple of these tips the next time you’re with your significant other and take note of the effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><sup>1</sup>Schröder, Jette, J., Schröder, C., &amp; Schmiedeberg.

      "rendered": "<p><strong>by Jasmyne Hinson</strong></p>\n<p>In relationships&#8211;as early as casual “situationships” and as seasoned as long-term commitments&#8211;it can be incredibly difficult to know when and how to bring up certain topics. These topics often include negative life experiences, relationship norms, sensitive topics, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/is-your-ex-in-your-new-relationship/\">prior romantic relationships</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/building-trust-after-cheating-how-to-regain-trust-after-your-partner-cheated-on-you/\">extra-relationship activity</a>. However, perhaps the most avoided topic is “the talk” &#8211; also known as the discussion pertaining to the state of the relationship. In fact, in a study of college relationships, over half of participants reported avoiding discussions about “the state of the relationship.”1 It is completely normal to experience relationship uncertainty. As we have various experiences with a dating partner, we may begin to tackle <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-reduce-jealousy-in-your-relationship/\">jealousy</a>, disappointment, and <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/why-do-couples-fight/\">conflict resolution</a> with our partner. All these changes can cause fluctuations in our confidence about the relationship.2 If you’ve found yourself wondering whether your person is willing to stay with you for the long term and struggling with the resulting ambiguity, it may be time for you to have “the talk”. In this article, we will discuss three strategies to prepare for a successful “state of the relationship” conversation with your partner.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tip 1: Mentally/Emotionally Preparing for the Conversation</strong></h2>\n<p>Before initiating “the talk” about where the relationship is going, it is important to first have an internal check-in to prepare. It is likely not in your best interest to have this potentially future-dictating, nerve-wracking conversation if you are not in a clear, rational head space. Relationship uncertainty is often associated with emotions like anger and sadness. Going into this situation with these feelings can cause you to undermine the effectiveness of the conversation. 2 Therefore, it may be beneficial to take a few deep breaths to calm down and assess why you’re feeling uncertain. What do I want to gain from &#8220;the talk&#8221;? What do we need to do to prepare? Both people in the relationship can benefit from taking a step back to reflect on their own thoughts, desires, and emotions. It may even be appropriate to schedule a time to talk with a rational mind and without interruption. Be honest with yourself before approaching the conversation and encourage your partner to do the same. Be ready to discuss the matter in a calm, solutions-oriented way instead of a combative, anxiety-driven way. This doesn’t mean your emotions aren’t relevant, but it will be helpful to compose your thoughts before trying to discuss in a vulnerable, kind way.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tip 2: Be Direct and Open</strong></h2>\n<p>During the conversation, it may feel easier to be indirect. However, not only does this prolong the discomfort for you, but it can also be ineffective and even detrimental in the future. We may expect indirect strategies to produce better results, but in the long run, being direct is associated with better long-term relationship success. 4 Even though it can be emotionally tough, it’s better to say exactly what you mean instead of leaving it to your partner’s interpretation.</p>\n<p>Open communication about uncertainty can strengthen the relationship and create a sense of closeness, trust, and transparency. When we communicate directly, we make the situation less ambiguous and we even create an environment where this “state of the relationship” conversation can happen again, if needed. 5 This is all to say that it is probably in your best interest to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-promote-intimacy-with-communication/\">remain vulnerable, honest, and straightforward during the conversation</a>, despite how nerve-wracking it may be.</p>\n<h2><strong>Tip 3: Face (And Accept) Your Fears</strong></h2>\n<p>Something important to acknowledge is that we cannot control our partner’s reactions to our desires and needs. There is always the gut-wrenching possibility that this conversation will lead to certain feared consequences. Whether it’s a breakup or an unfortunate compromise, try to remember that your partner is an individual with separate experiences, desires, and needs that matter as much as yours. It is natural to hope that these desires match perfectly with yours, but expectations like these often lead to disappointment, resentment, or controlling behaviors.</p>\n<p>A central reason many of us hold back from having this conversation is simply because we know it’s risky. This is especially amplified in “state of the relationship” issues because the more risk we perceive, the less vulnerable we are willing to be. 6  Sometimes, there is the tendency to want to retreat to passivity or indirectness when we experience relationship uncertainty. 2 Although indirect communication is appropriate in some situations, when you decide to have an important conversation with your partner, lack of transparency usually hinders clarity about the state of the relationship. Therefore, acknowledging and accepting the fear while making the conscious effort to move forward despite the <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/is-anxiety-interfering-with-your-relationship-2/\">anxiety</a> is key to successfully addressing the ambiguity.</p>\n<h2><strong>You Can Do This</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s completely normal to be anxious when thinking about how to start a conversation like this. There’s a reason so many people avoid it! It can be scary not knowing where your relationship is going with a person you care about, and it can be even scarier thinking of all the ways the conversation can go wrong. However, if you’re assertive and remain honest—both with your partner and with yourself—then you will be successful and will have the reward of clarity and mutual understanding waiting on the other side. By utilizing these tips, you can bring yourself one step closer to knowing exactly what the state of the relationship is and conquer “the talk.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Knobloch, L.

      "rendered": "<p><strong>by Rawan Eldabbas</strong></p>\n<p>Are you and your partner experiencing consistent obstacles in your relationship? Contrary to what you might think, differing interests may not be the cause. Believe it or not, you and your partner’s family background can play a major role in your relationship.</p>\n<h2><strong>Effects of Family Background?</strong></h2>\n<p>Hearing the term “family background,” you might think of your partner’s <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/5-tips-for-navigating-intercultural-interracial-relationships/\">culture</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/have-faith-in-love-how-to-date-people-with-different-religious-beliefs/\">religion</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/will-differing-political-views-ruin-your-relationship/\">political affiliation</a>. While all these categories play a part, there are lots of other components as well. It actually relates to all of the various aspects of one’s environment in their childhood home which eventually informs how one views relationships, communication, and intimacy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/is-anxiety-interfering-with-your-relationship/\">Parental attitudes</a> towards their children has an important effect on their self-esteem and confidence later in life. Parents who participate in consistent positive affirmation can help instill healthy decision-making and greater self-confidence in their children. On the contrary, children who were often criticized and scolded due to harsh expectations frequently develop insecurities which may contribute to greater marital conflicts later in life.</p>\n<p>Parents often stress common ideologies, such as particular gender roles, which can lead the children to implement them in future relationships. In cases where there are conflicting ideologies­ in a marriage, it is important to achieve a mutual understanding of each partner’s roles early on to ensure harmony and understanding.</p>\n<p>Here are a few ways that your partner’s family background can affect different aspects of your relationship.</p>\n<h2><strong>Attitudes on Communication</strong></h2>\n<p>If you find that you or your partner lack communication skills, it is important to consider the reasons behind this. It might be difficult for one/both of you to express how you feel &#8211; possibly because it is a foreign concept. Maybe one/both of your parents never asked how you were feeling growing up. Maybe they didn’t prioritize conversations about personal topics, and that later caused discomfort confiding in the other. This is because a lack of <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/is-lack-of-emotional-support-a-problem-in-your-relationship/\">emotional support</a> early in life can manifest into a strong sense of emotional autonomy and a potential lack of sensitivity towards other people’s feelings.</p>\n<p>As a way of understanding yourself or your partner, attempt to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-promote-intimacy-with-communication/\">recognize this issue of communication early in the relationship</a>, and find out the potential origin behind these habits together (in a non-blaming yet accountable way). While this can be a challenging task, being there for each other to tackle the problem’s source is a good start. This can help strengthen the trust within the relationship and help you both work as a team along the way.</p>\n<h2><strong>Attitudes on Gender Roles</strong></h2>\n<p>Parents may raise their children according to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/the-actual-difference-between-men-and-women-when-it-comes-to-relationships/\">gender-based expectations</a>. For example, one family may raise boys with less emotional affection (e.g., telling them to “ be tough”) while girls are supported when they are upset. Another family might assume girls are being dramatic when expressing intense emotions and that boys’ intense emotions must be warranted. You might also notice that some families highlight different responsibilities based on gender. For example, men are stereotypically expected to oversee finances and/or manual labor while women are stereotypically expected to oversee cooking, cleaning, and childcare. However, expectations are changing in many Western, industrialized nations such that women are now expected to <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-true-damage-of-second_b_8224148\">work full-time as well as take on the bulk of the house and childcare</a>.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the specific messages, gender expectations these have a strong influence on your behavior in relationships later on as well as your expectations for your partner’s behavior. However, being mindful of these differences in expectations can help partners find a middle ground so that both partners are happy with their own and their partner’s roles as it relates to gender.</p>\n<h2><strong>Attitudes on Intimacy</strong></h2>\n<p>Do you feel as though your partner doesn’t show you affection, and it makes you feel upset or lonely? Or would you like to show your partner the affection that they need but feel unable to? You should know that both positions are completely normal but may indicate a distinct difference between how both of you were taught to perceive affection.</p>\n<p>The desire to feel comfort and warmth from another person is <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-important-is-an-intimate-relationship/\">innate</a>. Unfortunately, some individuals may be more familiar with this than others. Children who constantly engaged in loving or comforting activities with their family are more likely to be emotionally expressive and secure. Whereas people who had harsh familial expectations or social limitations when they were younger may be uncomfortable, fearful or indifferent to forming connections with others. Growing up in a family that doesn’t display physical or verbal signs of affection makes it hard to know how to show love towards a partner. In their future relationships, the unfamiliarity with intimate conversations might even have a negative impact on their sex life, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/reigniting-the-fire-how-to-talk-about-sex-with-your-partner/\">making it quite uncomfortable for them to engage in it</a>.</p>\n<p>Naturally, being with a partner who doesn’t engage in intimate behavior may lead you to question if they truly love you or if you are doing something wrong. However, they simply might not know how to show it. And as the less intimate partner, you may similarly wonder what is wrong with you or wonder why your partner needs so much attention and affection. Yet again, understanding and accountable communication will be crucial for you two in order to come to an agreement of how much emotional intimacy is expected and how to appropriately ask for more space or connection.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>While your family background might not affect all these aspects in your relationship, it is important to understand the role that your upbringing plays in your understanding and engagement in romantic relationships. At the end of the day, understanding you and your partner’s family backgrounds can help create a different dynamic for your relationship as you decide which influences will serve you well and which ones you would like to improve for the health of your relationship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.ourrelationship.com/\">www.ourrelationship.com </a></strong></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>by Caitlin McNulty</strong></p>\n<p>The events and activities that once excited you and your partner in the beginning of your relationship now seem normal and unexciting due to their reoccurrence. If you feel as though you and your partner have reached a stalemate in relationship excitement, try engaging in the activities below to combat boredom and reignite passion and commitment in your relationship.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Find New and Exciting Activities to Do Together</strong></span></h2>\n<p>One reason your relationship may feel dull lately is because you and your partner have fallen into a routine. You may have made a habit in only partaking in certain activities when you are together. While it is good that you and your partner have found common interests, finding a <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/10-couples-activities-that-will-strengthen-your-relationship/\">new, exciting activity to do together</a> can greatly enhance your relationship satisfaction. Researchers have found that when you and your partner engage in a new and exciting activity together, you will experience greater relationship quality and express more positive behaviors toward one another. This can occur for various reasons. Firstly, it can lead to a heightened sense of arousal, which increases your attraction to your partner. Secondly, partaking in an activity in which you and your partner must work together reignites cooperation and a sense of teamwork in your relationship. Finally, successfully completing a new and exciting activity can increase your positive emotions overall, which will carry over into a positive view of your romantic relationship. Engaging in a new and exciting activity can increase your relationship satisfaction in a multitude of ways and get you and your partner out of your rut. Next time you are planning a <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/the-importance-of-date-night/\">date night</a>, instead of going to dinner at your favorite restaurant or going to the movies, suggest something more exciting that you have never done before – such as hiking, attending an outdoor concert or event, dancing, or going to an escape room. Step outside of your comfort zone as a couple and feel your relationship satisfaction drastically increase.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Avoid Using Your Cell Phone when Spending Time Together</strong></span></h2>\n<p>A lot of us are overly attached to our cell phones and struggle to step away from our screens throughout the day. Although it is beneficial to connect with others so easily, constantly checking social media or being a call or text away from family, friends, and coworkers 24/7 can be threatening your relationship satisfaction. Research shows that when one partner is glued to his or her cell phone while in the presence of the other partner, the couple’s relationship satisfaction can deteriorate – especially if one partner wants to be communicating but the other chooses to be on their phone. This situation can cause couples to argue about appropriate cell phone use while together. However, you and your partner can avoid this conflict by specifying certain times in your day to spend technology-free. You and your partner can lay some easy ground rules to make sure you are on the same page regarding cell phone use. Suggest not using your cell phone while eating meals together, not using your cell phone for an hour or two before bed at night, or not using your cell phone when waking up in the morning until after eating breakfast. By setting aside time to be in each other’s presence technology-free, you will avoid bickering about cell phone use by designating times to effectively <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/7-steps-to-understanding-the-importance-of-communication-in-a-relationship/\">communicate</a> and spend <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-balance-spending-time-together-in-your-relationship/\">quality time </a>together.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Express Gratitude Toward Your Partner More Frequently</strong></span></h2>\n<p>After spending a significant amount of time with your partner, it can become easy to overlook everything they do for you because it begins to feel normal. However, take a minute to stop and think about everything your partner does for you to make your daily life easier and help decrease your stress. Being actively grateful for everything your partner does for you has multiple benefits for improving your relationship satisfaction. Firstly, showing appreciation for your partner has a reciprocal effect. Your partner will feel more appreciative of you when you demonstrate your appreciation for them. This cyclical nature of appreciation increases a couples’ <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-important-is-an-intimate-relationship/\">closeness</a> by making them more responsive and aware of one another’s needs. This dynamic increases a couples’ commitment to one another, which increases overall relationship satisfaction. Next time your partner does the dishes after dinner, takes the dog out for a walk, or brings you coffee in the morning, make sure to thank them out loud so that they are aware of how grateful you are for them. Your partner will appreciate the fact that you noticed their efforts and will want to continue to do things for you. Don’t forget to also <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/the-complete-guide-to-the-different-love-languages-and-what-they-mean/\">do things for your partner</a> in return. This way, you will both be appreciative of the role you play in each other’s lives and feel more committed to one another. No matter how long you have been with someone, it is important to remind them that their contributions to the relationship are not going unnoticed.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>By: Julian Zarate</strong></p>\n<p>Jealousy is something many of us have encountered at one point or another in our relationships. Jealousy is a very complex emotion that often includes touches of anger, frustration, fear, sadness, and even depression.<sup>(3)</sup> In romantic relationships, jealousy originates from the feeling that one’s relationship is at risk, which are often caused by various belief patterns and experiences.<sup>(3)(6)</sup> Maybe you have experienced jealousy when you compared yourself to the hot bartender that tried flirting with your significant other? Or maybe a past relationship led you to develop trust issues and that feeling of doubt is always wriggling in the back of your mind?</p>\n<p>It’s important to recognize that these feelings are completely natural, and potentially even helpful. Research suggests jealousy has an evolutionary advantage which motivates us to strengthen our relationship when faced with a threat. Specifically, these feelings and their associated actions are believed to secure paternity for males and maintain security and resources for females.<sup>(3)</sup> However, extreme jealousy can actually become a threat to the relationship itself when it interferes with one or both partner’s <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/your-partner-doesnt-trust-you/\">trust and freedom</a>. Consider the following tips to protect your relationship from the negative effects of jealousy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2><b>Reflect on the Meaning of your Feelings</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the most basic ways to fight against feelings of jealousy is to understand exactly <i>why</i> you feel jealous. It might seem obvious on the surface, but there is often a deeper reason why the green-eyed monster is popping his head over your shoulder. It may seem tempting to blame your partner’s behavior for your feelings of jealousy, but many sources of jealousy are actually internal! Jealousy in relationships often stems from feelings of insecurity or the desire to control your partner. Interestingly, the desire to control your partner can also originate from deeper feelings of insecurity! <sup>(2)(6)</sup></p>\n<p>However, beyond recognizing the internal origins of your feelings, it is often beneficial to reflect on the specific moments that incited the jealousy.<sup>(2)</sup> Are there certain things your partner does which remind you of an ex who strayed? Or perhaps you only feel jealous when your partner hangs around “that friend”. Pinpointing specific events that triggered feelings of jealousy can shed light on why you felt jealous in the first place.<sup>(2)</sup> Even more importantly, it can tell you what situations you can try to avoid or at least prepare for to minimize the effects of jealousy.<sup>(4)</sup></p>\n<p>At the same time, it is important to try not to get caught up in the feeling of jealousy itself. Sometimes when we think back on specific memories or events, we can get caught up in those negative emotions and fall into a <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/is-anxiety-interfering-with-your-relationship-2/\">cycle of negativity</a>. This is what psychologists call “rumination”. It might be difficult, but try your best to avoid “re-playing” the scenes in your head. Instead, use them solely as reference, and focus on how these events affected you. <sup>(1)</sup></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h2><b>Have an Open Discussion with Your Partner</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you have taken time to understand your own jealous feelings, try to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/is-lack-of-communication-a-problem-in-your-relationship/\">communicate</a> this understanding with your partner. Let your partner know that you’d like to talk and find a quiet place and time when you won’t be interrupted. You deserve a space to share your feelings and the inciting events. At the same time, your partner deserves a space to share their side of the story. Together, partners should work to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/5-things-you-can-do-to-protect-and-strengthen-your-relationship/\">establish boundaries and compromises</a> that can alleviate both partners’ concerns.<sup>(2)</sup> For instance, if your partner has a friend that makes you feel insecure, your partner may not find it fair to be forced to completely cut that person out of their life. However, perhaps a compromise to lessen the frequency of outings with that friend would work, or better yet, an increase in quality time with your partner instead!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, vulnerable discussions like these often lead to heightened emotions. If one partner feels persecuted or distressed, it could lead to anger, disappointment, frustration, or worse. For this reason, it is important that both parties attempt to limit destructive communication and behaviors. For a productive outcome, both partners should refrain from verbal or physical aggression and from weaponizing jealousy through intentionally making one another jealous. If either partner notices that emotions are flaring, take a break and continue the discussion later, after tempers have cooled. <sup>(4)</sup></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h2><b>Reaffirm the Relationship</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Beyond the boundaries and compromises of a couple’s open discussion, it may be beneficial for the two of you to intentionally reaffirm the security of the relationship. Little gestures can go a long way if they are genuine. If a partner is prone to jealousy, occasional reassurances of the relationship’s strength can work wonders! <sup>(4)(6)</sup></p>\n<p>Sometimes reassurance can be as simple as a few key words. There is nothing wrong with giving a bit of <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/ways-to-get-and-give-emotional-support-in-your-relationship/\">unsolicited support</a>, and there is nothing wrong with asking for reassurance in moments that you feel insecure or vulnerable. If you know that your partner has a tendency to get jealous in particular situations, you can make an effort to remind them of their meaning to you as a partner.<sup>(4)(6)</sup> And if you feel that words aren’t enough, small gifts can offer support as well! <sup>(6)</sup> Ideally, these <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/the-complete-guide-to-the-different-love-languages-and-what-they-mean/\">affirmations and gifts</a> should go both ways; if you are prone to jealousy, then your accommodating partner deserves assurance and gifts as well.</p>\n<p>These reassurances go a long way in open discussions as well. If your partner opens up to you about their jealous feelings (or about other vulnerabilities in their lives), then aim to accept these feelings as openly as possible. Try to avoid overly expressing defensiveness, but also don’t be afraid to assert your own feelings. Boundaries should be set by both parties; you can make compromises on how to fight against jealousy while still reaffirming your partner about their position in the relationship.<sup>(6)</sup></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h2><b>Consider Outside Help</b></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If open communication and compromises haven’t been successful, then you may wish to consider outside help.<sup>(3)</sup> Sometimes feelings of jealousy stem from sources that are difficult to work on without a third-party perspective, particularly if the feelings are long-lasting, frequent, and interfering with relationship satisfaction.<sup>(4)</sup></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.OurRelationship.com\">The OurRelationship program</a> is an excellent free (or low-cost) online resource for couples struggling with jealousy because it allows each partner to develop a DEEP understanding of the issue. In the program, partners learn about their Differences, External stressors, underlying Emotions, and Patterns of communication. Learning about each partner’s DEEP understanding fosters empathy and awareness within the relationship whenever jealousy arises in the future. Even further, the program guides the couple to make specific changes which may include avoiding situations that evoke jealousy or changing communication styles when a partner feels jealous. Throughout the program, couples meet virtually with a relationship coach to help them communicate their issue, DEEP understanding, and desired changes effectively.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>However, if you want to work through this issue more intensely with a therapist, couple therapy can also be a great resource.</p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p>Jealousy can be a difficult hurdle in any relationship, but it can be overcome with a little preparation and effort. Simply working with your partner can be enough to stabilize a relationship burdened by jealousy. Open, judgment-free communication and self-reflection are useful for various relationship problems even beyond jealousy. Implementing these tips and communicating openly with your partner should allow you to work together to overcome jealousy in any form.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>References</b></p>\n<p><sup>1 </sup>Elphinston, R.

This may seem obvious, but, upon closer examination, it isn’t as simple as you think. Sex in the context of relationships can seem simple or one-dimensional. You may view sex between monogamous partners as a way to satisfy each other’s needs, but its role in relationships is often deeper than that. In this article, we will first discuss the importance of a healthy sex life, then we will move onto the methods you can use to not only improve sexual satisfaction, but also improve the relationship as a whole.</p>\n<p>First, let’s talk about why sex is important for your personal well-being. Studies have long supported that sex is important. As humans, we have sexual needs and desires that can boil over in nasty ways if left unsatisfied. However, the importance of having sex goes beyond just meeting our evolutionary needs. In fact, unaddressed sexual desires can result in an overall decline in mental and physical health. It is also an intense source of affection within a relationship. When you are vulnerable with your partner in this way, you are choosing to share your body and desires with them which can create a bond and experience unique to sexual intimacy. Affection at such a high level communicates that your partner is attracted to you and trusts you. Now that we’ve established that sex, in general, is beneficial for you and your partner, let’s discuss what steps to take to have a healthier sex life that also benefits other areas of your relationship.</p>\n<h2><b>When you have the urge, tell your partner!</b></h2>\n<p>For several internal and external reasons, sex can be difficult to discuss. Due to anxiety or societal taboos, you might be nervous or embarrassed to discuss the sexual desires you have with your partner. As hard as it can be, communication is essential for better and healthy sex. One reason for this is simple &#8211; sex is better when both partners want it. Studies show that people have more frequent and better sex when sexual desire is higher. Open communication can help one another understand when each person desires sexual activity. If you find yourself wanting to have sex, do not hesitate to tell your partner. They may be feeling the same way! However, present your desires in a welcoming, pressure-free way, as it’s extremely important to only have sex if your partner shares your desire.</p>\n<h2><b>Discuss your specific desires and needs.</b></h2>\n<p>It’s also important to discuss the specifics of what you want and do not want in your sex life. Not only does this lead to better sex, but sexual communication is strongly associated with relationship satisfaction. If you have a sexual fantasy or desire that you are too shy to tell your partner, do your best to be open with them. If it’s difficult for you to discuss sex with your partner, you could show them what you want physically or work your way up from a desire you suspect they would be open to.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Open sexual communication improves more than sexual satisfaction. When you decide to share these thoughts with your partner you are telling them that you love and trust them enough to share your deepest and most private thoughts. This level of vulnerability can<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>bring you even closer to the one you love.</p>\n<h2><b>Create an emotionally welcoming environment.</b></h2>\n<p>Although communication is important, you should never force someone you love to discuss something that makes them uncomfortable or that they are not ready to share. It’s important to be aware of our partners’ feelings and behaviors when discussing intimate topics. It can be very difficult for some people, particularly those who tend to avoid situations that require them to open up about their emotions,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>If your partner falls into this category, try your best to create a warm environment by showing unconditional support and by communicating you would never judge them for who they are. Receiving the messages that you care for and accept them may encourage them to stay and talk with you rather than avoiding difficult conversations about sex. As we’ve explored, this communication can then lead to a healthier sex life, and more importantly, a happier relationship.</p>\n<p>The critical takeaway from this conversation is that communication and authentic sex is crucial for sexual and relationship satisfaction. Studies tell us that the expression “quality over quantity” applies to healthy sex lives as well. In fact, there is, at most, only a small correlation between sexual satisfaction and sexual frequency. However, sex can provide emotional and physical intimacy in a way that no other activity can. When you choose to share your physicality with your partner you can show love and trust in a very impactful manner. Try your best to communicate your sexual needs, frustrations, desires, and fears with your partner. First, have a conversation with your significant other about your sex life. Ask them if there’s anything about your current sexual relationship that they are unsatisfied with. Remember to be understanding and open to new ideas. Having these types of conversations can lead to a happier relationship with enhanced trust and intimacy.</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Debrot, A., Meuwly, N., Muise, A., Impett, E.

My fear was big, but my feelings of emptiness and loss of self from not being able to let go of an extremely toxic relationship got me through the waiting. I was surprised to see the room fill up with about 50 people, mostly younger adults, with equal amounts of men and women. The severity of the stories ranged, but the feelings and attributes of codependence were all shared. I did not feel out of place, but rather left the meeting knowing that there is a lack of awareness for what codependency is and who is affected by it. I no longer wanted to be in codependent relationships that drained me, I wanted to build relationships with healthy boundaries. To make this change, I knew an important part of my recovery would be to explore where this dynamic originated. I hope to share my knowledge on the subject to help others who also wish to change.</p>\n<h2><b>What is codependency in terms of romantic relationships?</b></h2>\n<p>Codependence has been described as a condition that is manifested through a dysfunctional pattern of relating to others. Characteristics of this behavior pattern include extreme dependence and preoccupation with another person, extreme focus outside of the self, lack of open expression of feelings, and a drive to gain a sense of purpose through relationships<sup>4</sup>. The term codependency arose in the 1980s to describe the family members of substance abusers. A common example of “attempting to gain a sense of purpose through relationships” would be the wife of an alcoholic who endures all the difficulties resulting from her husband’s alcoholism but justifies her situation with the terms “he needs me”. She feels purposeful as her husband’s “fixer”<sup>10</sup>. A recurrent theme in the literature on codependency is the “loss of self”. The need to maintain a relationship, even an unhealthy one, is so powerful that codependent individuals tend to suppress their feelings, needs, and desires to please their partner<sup>4</sup>. A codependent person may not want to engage in a disagreement due to their fear of losing or upsetting their partner even if they feel strongly on the subject at hand. This cost of self-expression ultimately leads to identity disturbances<sup>4</sup>. Codependency has also been characterized as a set of self-defeating, learned behaviors that diminish the capacity to initiate and participate in healthy, loving relationships<sup>5</sup>. The keyword in such definitions is “learned”. It puts into question where do these codependent tendencies come from?</p>\n<h2><b>Where does codependency originate? Exploring the power of attachment style</b></h2>\n<p>Because attachment affects how people think, behave, and feel in close relationships, we must explore attachment theory to understand codependency<sup>3</sup>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Infants turn to their caregivers for support during times of fear, anxiety, or distress. These early experiences help the infant develop an internal representation of a “caregiver”<sup>3</sup>. Three principal attachment patterns emerge from these early caregiver interactions: secure attachment, insecure attachment (ambivalent or avoidant), and disorganized attachment. Attachment styles in infancy help predict various aspects of social development including the trajectory of adult romantic relationships<sup>1</sup>. Thus, there is a link between codependency in romantic relationships and in secure attachment styles starting in infancy. Insecure attachment in infancy comes from inconsistent availability from caregivers during times of distress. This type of inconsistent parenting during childhood can create a fixation on keeping people close. Many infants may grow up to worry that their needs can’t or won’t be met consistently. They may be preoccupied with abandonment and have expectations that others won’t be there for them<sup>2</sup>. By adolescence, these early attachment experiences and feelings towards caregivers are internalized and incorporated into our personalities<sup>2</sup>. Anxiously attached adults worry excessively about losing their romantic partners, are heavily invested in their relationship, have negative self-views, question their self-worth, and yearn to get closer emotionally to feel more secure<sup>5</sup>. People in codependent relationships rely on each other not for love and care, but for relief from these feelings of insecurity. It is safe to say that codependent individuals have some degree of anxious attachment as a result of negative early childhood experiences with their caregivers, which is manifested in their adult romantic relationships.</p>\n<h2><b>Common Codependent Behaviors</b><b><sup>5</sup></b><b>:</b></h2>\n<h4>● Being a caretaker</h4>\n<h4>● Controlling</h4>\n<h4>● High-stress levels</h4>\n<h4>● Tend to be people-pleasers</h4>\n<h4>● Want to feel needed</h4>\n<h4>● Fear of abandonment</h4>\n<h4>● Dependent on relationships</h4>\n<h4>● Hard time trusting others</h4>\n<h4>● Denial</h4>\n<h2><b>Is codependency bad? Tips on breaking the pattern of codependency</b></h2>\n<p>Codependent relationships are often unfulfilling and sometimes abusive. Codependent individuals are at a higher risk for other mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression<sup>2</sup>. Codependency leads to damaging relationships and deprives people of the chance to meet their own needs. Leaving codependent relationships and working on changing codependent tendencies allows you to have relationships that stem from love rather than necessity. Let’s explore some tips on making this change.</p>\n<h3><b>Contextualize your codependent tendencies and embrace healthy relationship characteristics you wish to improve (ex: lower your relationship anxiety)</b><b><sup>9</sup></b></h3>\n<p>Acknowledgment is the first step to healing and changing. Acknowledging anxious attachment and wanting to change has proven to decrease codependent tendencies. Research has found that people who acknowledge their wish to become more secure and less anxious in relationships decreased attachment anxiety at a faster rate than people who did not. Having such “change goals” will help you act less anxious and maintaining these change goals over a period of time causes them to become learned and habitual.</p>\n<h3><b>Look into Co-Dependents Anonymous Org. (meetings, webinars, etc.) </b><b><sup>10</sup></b><b> </b></h3>\n<p>Group therapies are effective for some codependent individuals. These group settings will help you acknowledge your relationship “addictions” while helping you to increase your self-esteem and self-worth. It also gives you a space to build networks and interests outside of your romantic relationship, which helps to build a sense of self. Co-Dependents Anonymous also has other resources such as books, workbooks, and podcasts to help in your recovery.</p>\n<h3><b>Practice meditation for anxiety relief within romantic relationships or moments of solitude</b><b><sup>11</sup></b></h3>\n<p>To decrease codependency, work on coping with the symptoms of anxiety which often stem from fears of abandonment, the need for control, fears of loneliness, etc. The practice of meditation, breathwork, and self-affirmation interventions, have all proven to be effective in decreasing anxiety. There are many apps and websites such as Headspace, Calm, and Buddhify that provide free meditation/breathwork exercises. Netflix and YouTube also have a wide range of guided meditations. With lower levels of anxiety, you can assess your fears from a more realistic point of view. This will help you cope with solitude and romantic relationships in a healthier manner.</p>\n<h2><b>Accepting Change</b></h2>\n<p>The good news is that change is possible. Studies have shown that by simply modifying your thoughts and behaviors to align with a desired trait, you can willingly change your attachment styles<sup>9</sup>. Working on being more secure in relationships has been associated with better functioning and more success in romantic relationships, better mental health (including less depressive and anxious symptoms), better physical health, higher friendship quality, and even better cognitive processes such as memory and attention<sup>9</sup>. Although it isn’t always easy, overcoming codependency will open the doors for you to engage in more loving relationships not only with a romantic partner, but also with yourself. It is important to be accepting and forgiving towards yourself during this time of healing. Just like I learned during my first CoDA meeting, you are not alone, and people can and do overcome codependence.</p>\n<p><b>References</b></p>\n<p><sup>1.</sup>Cassidy, J., &amp; Berlin, L. J.

However, not everyone considers the importance of their partner’s religious beliefs. A study from 2014 showed that approximately 60% of Americans said that their spouse shares the same religion as them – down from 80% decades ago.<sup>1</sup> Today there is evidence to suggest that fewer people are practicing religion in general. In 2014, 23% of Americans indicated not being affiliated with a religion whereas in 2018 the number rose to 26%.<sup>2</sup> This could contribute to the decrease in the number of couples of the same religion, but this brings up a more important question: Does having different religious beliefs make a difference in the quality of relationship? The role religion plays in a relationship varies from couple to couple. For some it might influence their lifestyle or child-rearing practices and for others it might just influence what day they attend services. Regardless of where you land on that spectrum, it is possible to date someone with different beliefs if you follow a few tips.</p>\n<h2><b>Tip 1: Decide if having the same religion is a relationship ‘must have’</b></h2>\n<p>When thinking about your ideal partner, do they have the same religion as you? Is that a non-negotiable for you or is it something that isn’t very important? These are important questions you should take into consideration when deciding whether to date someone. In order to get to know yourself and your desires better, make a list of pros and cons of dating someone with the same religion. What aspects of religion or religious beliefs are especially important to you? Will it be beneficial for your children to learn the same thing from both parents? Will being with someone of the same religion set you in your ways and not allow you to be open to new ways of thinking? If you decide it is something that you do ultimately want in your partner, then seek out dating pools where you have a good chance of finding like-minded people. For people in college, this might include attending the campus faith organization meetings. For others, look to attend church groups or bible studies and be open to meeting people there. There are also dating apps for singles of specific religious affiliations. Any of these avenues can help you meet people if you decide that you want to date within your same religion.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>Tip 2: Be open and communicate about different beliefs</b></h2>\n<p>Having differences does not mean you are incompatible; it just means you need to work to understand the differences and similarities. Being open and trying to understand each other will help a lot in deciding if you are more similar than you are different, because odds are you are similar in at least some areas. Many of the world religions are very similar and revolve around some core ideas such as loving others, treating people kindly, and being generous among many others. However, one difference lies in that Christians and conservative Protestants are less likely to be supportive of interfaith relationships than Evangelicals.<sup>3 </sup>If your partner is of a different faith background, put in effort to learn more about that religion. Not only will this help you understand what your partner believes, it will show your partner that you care about them and want to know them more. However, it is important to note that not everything that the religion teaches is what your partner believes. They might agree or disagree with certain aspects of their religion, and this is where becomes important. Ask your partner what they believe and inform them of what you believe. A longitudinal study of interfaith relationships showed that higher levels of this kind of open communication led to less relationship distress and that having interfaith relationships did not predict higher levels of breakup.<sup>4</sup> Perhaps set up a date for this discussion so that you can both dedicate time and effort to a meaningful conversation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>Tip 3: Make sure you and your partner are on the same page about sex.</b></h2>\n<p>People of different religions have different beliefs about sex and its place before and during marriage. If sex is in important part of a dating relationship for you, then you make sure you communicate that to your potential or current partner so that they can tell you their preferences and stance on the topic. It is important to know that not all people who practice religions are against extramarital sex. Studies show that people who attend church or religious services regularly are less likely to engage in premarital sex. In contrast, people who are practicing but do not attend organized services tend to have more casual sex.<sup>5</sup> For example, practicing Christians who attend religious services might be less open to the idea of having sex in a dating relationship and their religious beliefs might permeate other aspects of the relationship as well such as cohabitation before marriage. There should never be a pressure on you or your partner to do something that is outside of your or their religious beliefs; if sex is something that one of you is not sure about doing, then it might be a good idea to give it more thought before rushing into it. Having a partner who does not practice the same religion as you might make it more difficult for you to stick to what you believe in and abstain from sex &#8211; especially if they see nothing wrong with it and try to convince you of why you should. Ultimately, the partner you are with should want you to do what you feel is best for yourself, especially if that means sticking to your religious beliefs and practicing your faith. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>Tip 4: Do not change just to appease your partner</b></h2>\n<p>After discussing your religion and beliefs with your partner, take note of how receptive and respectful they are of what you have to say. If they say something that puts your beliefs down, then it is time to consider if this is the right relationship for you. Religion often is connected to your family, culture, and identity<sup>6</sup>, so it’s important they respect that part of you. There can be benefits of having a partner of a different faith and your differences should be celebrated because ultimately who wants to marry a clone of themselves?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p>To date, or not to date, the decision is up to you. It is important to remember that just because you and a partner are a different religion does not mean you are more likely to break up. As long as you take the extra steps necessary to know and understand your partner, it is possible to thrive in an interfaith relationship. First, make sure it’s what you want. Next, be open and communicate about what differences you might have. Then, bring up important relationship topics (like sex). Finally, do not change anything about yourself or your partner to make a relationship work. Be intentional about considering these steps, but ultimately, choose a relationship that you know is right for you, and have faith in love.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Murphy, Carlyle.

      "rendered": "<p>I bet there are certain topics in your relationship that you know will always cause a fight. Maybe it’s money or parenting. Maybe it’s chores or in-laws. The truth is, relationships are filled with communication conflict. Some of it can be anticipated (like with a “hot topic” above), while some of it can feel like it’s coming completely out of the blue.</p>\n<p>Verbal disagreements can occur when we feel attacked, unheard, or misunderstood. More simply, researchers have proposed that communication conflict arises when one partner’s pursuit of his or her goals interferes with the other partner’s goals. These “goals” aren’t necessarily tangible things like “finish the laundry,” they merely refer to desires, wishes, or plans that may or may not be conscious. Let’s use the following example:</p>\n<p>John and Sarah are expecting a baby in the coming months. John was raised Catholic and believes that religion plays a pivotal role in a child’s life. Sarah was raised Unitarian and was not taught to see religion as particularly important to children’s upbringings. Today, John brought up his desire for their baby to be baptized; Sarah scoffed at John’s feelings and immediately dismissed them as ridiculous. “It’s not like the baby will remember one day—who cares?” she mocked. John—feeling attacked—began lashing out at Sarah for her “inability to raise a Christian child” because of her disrespect for him and for Catholicism. They proceeded to fight for the next 30 minutes before both went to separate rooms to cool off.</p>\n<p>According to the goal-oriented view of relationship conflict, we’ll need to look at each partner’s goals to understand what is happening during this fight. John’s goal is to raise his child in a home that teaches and upholds religion—particularly Catholicism. Part of that goal includes having his baby baptized. From this interaction, we can interpret that Sarah’s views of raising her child did not include baptism. But that’s all we know about her goal. Perhaps Sarah is completely aligned with John’s goal up with the exception of the baptism? Or, perhaps they are entirely mis-aligned on their ideas of religion and parenting.</p>\n<p>Because relationships are made up of two individuals with their own individual needs, desires, and goals—conflict is, unfortunately, inevitable. There will always be times where the needs of one compromises the needs of the other. Accepting that fact to be true is an important first step to understanding and getting ahead of relationship conflict or fights…</p>\n<p>By accepting that fights are always going to rear their ugly head in our relationships, we gain a sort of power over them. Let’s go back to Sarah and John. Instead of Sarah making a joke about John’s desire for their baby to be baptized, what might have happened if Sarah asked him why baptism is so important to John? Had she done so, the two could have engaged in meaningful and calm conversation about the importance of religion—with no harsh or disrespectful language. Similarly, had John not immediately attacked Sarah for being unfit to raise a religious child, perhaps he could have calmly asked “what are your views on raising our child Catholic?” By engaging in a discussion, both Sarah and John would have likely left the conversation having a much deeper sense of each other’s goals and feelings surrounding the raising of their child. With both partners’ goals in mind, compromise is a logical next step.</p>\n<h2>How to reduce conflict in your relationship</h2>\n<p>Although we will always have disagreements, we do have a choice about how to navigate them. Sometimes it can feel easier and less vulnerable to simply attack our partner, mock them, or accuse their belief as being wrong. In doing so, we get even farther away from resolving the fight. And the conflict from that fight may even spill into other areas of the relationship.</p>\n<p>For couples who are unhappy in their relationships, it becomes even more important to try to get ahead of conflict, or understand the ways conflict can be reduced—since unhappy couples are 10x more likely than happier couples to use a negative tone of voice during a disagreement, engage in the same patterns each time an argument bubbles to the surface, and remain in conflict for longer periods of time. So, how do you reduce conflict?</p>\n<h3>Makes Conflict Worse – things NOT to do</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the opportunity to bring up other problems in the relationship</li>\n<li>Only blame your partner for the problem</li>\n<li>Listen to your partner just so you can criticize him/her</li>\n<li>Ask hostile and closed-ended questions</li>\n<li>Assume you know what your partner is thinking and feeling about the issue</li>\n<li>Repeat your own positions and opinions</li>\n<li>Follow your partner’s complaint with your own complaint</li>\n<li>Try to prove that your partner is wrong</li>\n<li>Tell your partner what he/she needs to do in order to solve the problem</li>\n<li>Make ultimatums</li>\n<li>Raise issues with a hostile tone</li>\n<li>Reject your partner’s view as wrong</li>\n<li>Interrupt your partner</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reduces or Avoids Conflict – things TO DO</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stay focused on the problem at hand</li>\n<li>Recognize how you are contributing to the conflict</li>\n<li>Listen to your partner with genuine interest; what is he/she saying?</li>\n<li>Ask open-ended questions</li>\n<li>Ask about his/her thoughts and feelings about the issue</li>\n<li>Summarize what your partner says to make sure you understand</li>\n<li>Follow your partner’s complaint with a request for more information</li>\n<li>Work towards agreement/compromise</li>\n<li>Offer constructive suggestions about what you can do to solve the problem</li>\n<li>Remain flexible during the problem-solving phase</li>\n<li>Raise issues in a neutral and gentle way</li>\n<li>Accept your partner’s views as important</li>\n<li>Let your partner finish her/his thoughts</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Our relationships are some of the most challenging and rewarding aspects of life. Finding someone you want to share your life with is a beautiful thing. Falling in love feels magical.</p>\n<p>In fact, falling in love <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/features/health-benefits\">has real health benefits</a> and has an impact on our bodies and our minds. Around <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/669037/share-of-americans-who-believe-in-love/\">87% of Americans</a> believe in true love, which is promising!</p>\n<p>But contrary to popular belief, love is not all you need. Relationships take a lot more than love to keep them going and love alone won&#8217;t keep a couple together.</p>\n<p>Successful relationships take a lot of work to keep both people happy and healthy. Read on for 7 things more important than love that you need to know to make your relationship work.</p>\n<h2>1. Trust</h2>\n<p>One of the most important parts of a relationship is to trust one another completely. You have to be able to trust that they won&#8217;t stray and you trust them with your feelings.</p>\n<p>You have to trust each other enough to be <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/test/\">vulnerable on an emotional</a> and physical level, too. A trusting relationship isn&#8217;t built overnight though, it takes time to grow.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re at the beginning of a relationship and the trust isn&#8217;t all there, give it time to grow. But if you&#8217;re in a long-term relationship and still don&#8217;t trust your partner, it&#8217;s not a good sign.</p>\n<h2>2. Vulnerability</h2>\n<p>Speaking of vulnerability, that&#8217;s the next one on this list. Vulnerability is important in a relationship and it&#8217;s beautiful with the right partner.</p>\n<p>Opening up to your partner without fear of judgment is amazing. They get to know you better and it can strengthen your relationship. If you don&#8217;t allow vulnerability, your relationship will suffer.</p>\n<p>Your partner may feel that you don&#8217;t trust them enough to let them in. They may feel shut out and that can be hurtful if they&#8217;re vulnerable with you.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t bottle it up. Open up and let vulnerability transform your relationship!</p>\n<h2>3. Communication</h2>\n<p>Communication, communication, communication. This is one of the most important aspects of a relationship, but so many couples struggle with it.</p>\n<p>There are many things in a relationship you can solve with effective communication. You need it to set boundaries, to solve problems, express feelings, and more.</p>\n<p>There are some aspects of a relationship that some people can find hard to talk about, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/reigniting-the-fire-how-to-talk-about-sex-with-your-partner/\">like sex for example</a>. But proper communication allows you to identify problems and come up with solutions.</p>\n<h2>4. Honesty</h2>\n<p>In a similar vein to trust, honesty is a huge factor in any relationship. Telling lies or hiding the truth from your partner can destroy your relationship.</p>\n<p>If there isn&#8217;t honesty in a relationship, it&#8217;s pretty much doomed. If there are a lot of little lies or a huge secret in the way, the truth will come out in the end. It will hurt your partner and it could end the relationship.</p>\n<p>Whatever it may be, you have to respect your partner enough to be honest with them. From there, you can work on the relationship, but lies won&#8217;t solve anything.</p>\n<h2>5. Loyalty</h2>\n<p>A huge pillar of a successful relationship is having loyalty to your partner. You need to be loyal to them and only them as your romantic partner. Unless you&#8217;ve both agreed and set boundaries to an open relationship, it&#8217;s non-negotiable.</p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t stay loyal and faithful to your partner, then ask yourself why you&#8217;re with them. Your commitment is paramount and you could cause a lot of pain to them if you&#8217;re unfaithful.</p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t be loyal to your partner, it&#8217;s kinder to end the relationship instead of hurting them further.</p>\n<h2>6. Respect</h2>\n<p>Respect is a huge part of any relationship. You need to have the utmost respect for your partner and yourself.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re in a relationship where you feel put down or degraded, your partner doesn&#8217;t respect you. You also need to respect yourself enough to leave such a situation.</p>\n<p>Both parties need to respect each other&#8217;s feelings and boundaries. You need to value and take care of each other in every way you can.</p>\n<p>When you respect and love one another, you&#8217;ll have a beautiful relationship. This foundation of trust and security is essential and will lead to wonderful things.</p>\n<h2>7. Affection</h2>\n<p>At the start of a relationship, you&#8217;re all loved up and can&#8217;t take your hands off each other. But as time goes on, the affection can dwindle and it&#8217;s important to get it back.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the little things like hand holding or random kisses throughout the day. These little actions show your partner that you love and care about them and it means a great deal.</p>\n<p>Everyone is affectionate in their own way, so take time to learn each others&#8217; love languages. When you find ways to show each other affection, it shows how much you mean to them and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Feeling unappreciated can damage your relationship. Learn how to communicate about bringing affection back and it can make a huge difference.</p>\n<h2>These Are the Keys to Successful Relationships</h2>\n<p>Relationships aren&#8217;t always easy and to keep them going both partners need to work hard. Love is a huge staple of a relationship but it&#8217;s not always enough to keep it strong.</p>\n<p>When you look at all the successful relationships in your life and other couples&#8217;, you&#8217;ll see these 7 things are in each of them. Some of these are harder to work at than others. This is when couples therapy can make a huge difference.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Do external stressors (e.g., finances, family issues, workload, etc.) negatively impact your life and often lead to fights between you and your partner? If so, this post will give you some ideas on how to better cope with stress in order to prevent fights.</p>\n<p>Many couples deal with external stress. While some stress is unavoidable, how we cope with it is often what leads to more problems in our relationships. Here are a few cycles that develop around this problem area: <strong>&#8220;This stress is killing me and my partner doesn’t get it&#8221;</strong> and <strong>&#8220;We are up to our ears in stress&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>One of you is experiencing external stress and may not know how to handle it. As a result, the stressed partner may pull away from the relationship or take it out on the other partner. The other partner may feel hurt that the partner is pulling away or feel like they need to walk on eggshells to avoid more fights.</p>\n<h2>I’m Buried in Stress</h2>\n<p>Stress can turn your partner from your biggest support system to your enemy. Instead of letting your stress drive a wedge in your relationship, consider the following tips.Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h3><strong>1. STOP, DROP, &#8230;</strong></h3>\n<p>Your partner only wants what is best for you. Try to notice when your stress is higher and STOP for a few moments before you accidentally take it out on your partner by snapping, yelling, or pulling away. Tell your partner you need 5 minutes, and use that time to yourself to de-stress and DROP your old habits.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. &#8230;and ENROLL</strong></h3>\n<p>Instead, you can use your partner as an ally against the stress. You may consider sharing with your partner what’s causing the stress (remember your DEEP Understanding and Speaker/Listener tips). If talking about it is too hard, tell your partner you are feeling stressed but that you want to spend time with him/her, even if you do not talk about the stressor. Consider taking a walk, watching your favorite TV show, playing a game, or something else that will allow you to spend time together.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. TELL YOUR PARTNER</strong></h3>\n<p>Sometimes it’s not possible to get your partner’s help in solving the stressor or to help you relax. If so, at least TELL your partner you’re feeling really stressed right now. When your partner knows that you’re stressed, he/she is less likely to take your behavior personally. You partner might even help out in extra ways if he/she knows you’re stressed.</p>\n<h2>Can’t My Partner Check their Stress at the Door?</h2>\n<p>The more your partner is stressed, the more he/she may take it out on you. While it may be hard to see your partner so stressed, you likely feel frustrated that it leads to him/her withdrawing from you or lashing out. You probably want to support your partner, but maybe you don’t know how to do it, or maybe your attempts at helping only seem to make things work. So what do you do when you feel so stuck? Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h3><strong>1. STAY UNITED</strong></h3>\n<p>Your best defense against your partner’s stress is handling the situation as a team. If this is your core issue, use the Respond conversation to decide with your partner what the expectations are for how you can stay united, despite the stressor. Once the two of you are on the same page, do your part to make the changes you agreed upon. When talking about your stress, continue to remind each other that regardless of what is going on, your relationship is a priority and that you can work through the stressful times together.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. PROVIDE SUPPORT</strong></h3>\n<p>You may not know the best way to provide support to your partner. Therefore, use the Respond conversation to ask your partner what is the best way to support him/her without making things worse. If your partner doesn’t know, consider using a Problem-Solving conversation activity in the 4th phase of the program to work together to identify the best method. Sometimes, talking about the problem is not helpful in the moment, so consider how else you may provide support like washing the dishes or something else off the to-do list (so your partner has less to worry about).</p>\n<p>In this cycle, both partners are under great amounts of stress and it negatively impacts the relationship. You both may pull away from each other in response to the stress or it may cause you to take your frustrations out on each other.</p>\n<h2>Stress Buries us Both</h2>\n<p>As you saw in the External Stress activity, when we’re stressed, we tend to communicate less effectively and assume the worst about our partners. Needless to say, that’s not good for relationships! You both may be so overwhelmed by stress that it is easier in the moment to take it out on each other or pull away &#8211; but this probably leaves both of you feeling hopeless and unsupported. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h3><strong>1. STAY UNITED</strong></h3>\n<p>Your best defense against stress is handling the situation as a team. Once the two of you are on the same page, do your part to make the changes you agreed upon.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. TELL YOUR PARTNER</strong></h3>\n<p>Sometimes it’s not possible to get your partner’s help in solving the stressor or to help you relax. Sometimes, you just need to get away from it all – and that includes your partner. If so, at least TELL your partner you’re feeling really stressed right now. When your partner knows that you’re stressed, he/she is less likely to take your behavior personally. You partner might even help out in extra ways if he/she knows you’re stressed.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. MAKE A PLAN AHEAD OF TIME</strong></h3>\n<p>When you’re feeling really stressed isn’t the best time to figure out how to deal with that stress. Instead, make a plan with your partner that you can put into action when you’re stressed. The plan should include: a) How will you let your partner know that you’re stressed?; b) What are you going to do in those situations (and for how long)?; and c) What should your partner do? And don’t forget to also make a plan for when your partner is stressed – you might be surprised at the differences!</p>\n<h3><strong>4. STAY ACTIVE OR DO SOMETHING FUN</strong></h3>\n<p>When the weight of stress becomes the focus of a relationship, other things often fall to the back burner. Even if you have no control over a stressor, you do have a control over your relationship and how you can stay connected. Try to prioritize some fun activities you can do together or doing something active like going on a walk at a local park. The stressor will not go away, but you will feel united and closer as a couple, which will make handling the stressor the next time much easier since you will feel more like a team.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

One of your initial thoughts might be “How do I support someone through this?” <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> During cancer treatment, support is integral to not only the patient, but to you as their caregiver. Social support has been found to have positive effects on treatment by reducing stress and improving emotional well-being.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>8</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Married female cancer patients report partner support as vital and has been associated with greater quality of life and lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> On the other hand, unsupportive behaviors, such as less empathy and affection, may lead to reduction in the patient’s ability to cope.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">, While it may be overwhelming as a caregiver due to the increase in responsibility, you can make a tremendous impact on your partner’s experience and possible road to recovery. Below are four tips on how to best support your partner through their cancer experience, while coping with the process yourself.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Talk to your partner about their cancer diagnosis and foster open communication with them about their emotional experiences.</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> From the onset of your partner’s diagnosis, you should communicate openly with them. Because cancer negatively affects the quality of both of your lives, you should face it together. Believe it or not, you both may be experiencing many of the same concerns and emotions, as chronic diseases often cause a detrimental impact on mental health in both the patients and spouses.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>6</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> For your spouse, it is reassuring and comforting to know that they will have robust support from a loved one throughout their diagnosis, treatment, and recovery stages.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Do not be afraid to disclose that you are feeling scared. Be honest, open, and willing to engage in discussions with your partner, as both of you are coping with major stressors. If conversations about your partner’s cancer diagnosis and challenges are avoided, it may lead to the perception from your partner that you are not supportive.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> As a caregiver, you might use this technique of avoidance as self-protection; however, this can increase your partner’s distress and intrusive thoughts about cancer.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Couples have reported that having supportive conversations about cancer positively influences their quality of life and has been perceived as being helpful.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> At the same time, negative communication, such as criticism, unhealthy disagreement, and discussing conflict topics, can be damaging to adaptive coping mechanisms.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>2 </sup></span><span class=\"s1\">Therefore, have discussions where you disclose specific emotional aspects of your experiences, possible approaches to their diagnosis and treatment, coping strategies, finances, household duties and roles, or simply ask them how you can help. Talk about the cancer, as it is related to post traumatic growth and increased appreciation of your loved ones.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> All in all, the more you support one another and engage in healthy discussions, the better your partner’s interpretation of their stressful cancer experience will be. There will be times you need to take on the role as listener and give them the space that they need to react and reflect.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>In daily activities, invisibly support your partner.</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> To gain a sense of connectedness with your partner in your day-to-day lives, you should support your partner on a daily basis. Invisible support is social support that is not visible to your partner; therefore, it goes unnoticed. An example of unobserved support is when you’ve completed household chores and do not mention it to your partner. Invisible support is an important aspect of alleviating stress from the patient, especially when completing daily tasks. Invisible support positively affects your partner’s outlook on challenging circumstances by making them seem less overwhelming.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> This kind of support is especially helpful to your partner, because it doesn’t reduce their feelings of self-efficacy.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>7</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> When your daily efforts to support your partner are made obvious to them, your partner may feel like they are incapable of accomplishing those goals on their own. However, when partners are invisibly supported in everyday life, it helps maintain intimacy, psychosocial adaptation, and is linked to a positive evaluation of the relationship, which, in turn, can alleviate distress.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>7</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> With that being said, help your partner with duties that will lessen their load without being told to do so, as it will make them feel less overwhelmed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Talk about sex and intimacy with your partner and challenge your preexisting perceptions.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> </b>Sexuality and intimacy in a relationship are directly correlated with quality of life and well-being.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Your partner’s cancer and treatments may pose a limitation to sexual desires and feelings of attractiveness. Therefore, it is important to foster open communication with one another about intimacy, possible limitations caused by cancer, and general feelings about sex. Acknowledge the issues that may be caused by your preexisting perceptions of frailty, chemotherapy, or even depression on libido.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> With cancer, couples usually perceive patients as “fragile,” thus, reducing their sexual desires and needs, which has a significant negative effect on their sexual relationship.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Sexual intimacy becomes less of a priority because of these associations. Do not think of sex as “frivolous activity,” as it may lead to you feeling guilty about your own wants.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Challenge those thoughts that you and your partner might have by recognizing and communicating those feelings.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Be aware of the possible limitations that cancer may pose, such as decreased libido</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>9</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">, and have a conversation with your partner and a healthcare professional about intimacy, sex, and alternative modes of sexual behavior. Some true limits need to be negotiated in these discussions, as cancer treatment can hinder sexual performance. If you cannot express your love for each other physically, demonstrate it on an emotional level. Most importantly, remind your partner that their recovery is the number one priority.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>To support your partner through cancer, you must take care of yourself first.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> This tip revolves around the idea that you cannot pour from an empty cup. Self-care is crucial for your mental and physical health. It serves as a method to prevent stress from escalating and to cope with it as it arises. Take time to enjoy life and know that it is okay to engage in activities that interest you. Exercise and be physically active to promote endorphins and prevent anxiety symptoms.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Find a supportive, loving, and trustworthy social network of friends, family members, and community resources. This support system can prevent depression and alleviate emotional distress in the initial months of your partner’s cancer.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> If your own needs are not met, it can lead to emotional vulnerability and conflict can follow, which can be detrimental to your relationship and partner’s coping strategies.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Additionally, find a list of resources and accurate information about cancer care. Obtaining correct information about cancer treatment can help you both in your decision-making process, preparation for treatment, and coping with the adverse effects of the medications.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>10</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> These are all measures that you can take to improve your psychological well-being and health during this difficult time.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Conclusion</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b> </b><span class=\"s1\">By facilitating open discussions with your partner about their experiences, emotions, and needs, and helping them with daily tasks leads to an improved quality of life for you and your partner. And know that everything doesn’t have to be about cancer. Go on dates at home, watch movies together, cook together, make time for each other as a couple. It is an overwhelming role to take on, but it is one that can be handled.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> <b>References</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>6</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">Baider, L., Perez, T., &amp; Kaplan De-Nour, A.

Being the non-socially anxious partner can be demanding and your partner’s behaviors may negatively affect the quality of your relationship and easily upset you. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Learning about social anxiety in relationships and how your socially anxious partner is likely to respond to situations can guide you to the best way to communicating with and understanding your partner’s feelings and behaviors. About 7% or 15 million U.S. adults have a diagnosed social anxiety disorder. </span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Social anxiety is associated with interpersonal difficulties which means that an individual with this diagnosis feels anxious in social interactions due to the fear of being negatively evaluated and rejected.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>2</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> As a way of responding to a perceived danger or threat of feeling rejected, socially anxious individuals withdraw easily from social gatherings or avoid social contact completely.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3 </sup></span><span class=\"s1\">Socially anxious individuals are less likely to get married or be in a romantic relationship.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4 </sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite this, it is clear that some people with social anxiety do seek out, desire and get involved in intimate relationships. As the non-socially anxious partner you may fail to recognize that some of the problematic ways your partner communicates with you in your relationship may be due to their social anxiety and is simply their way of taking precautions and managing risk regulation. Below we will examine what some of the difficulties are that socially anxious individuals express in romantic relationships and what you can do about them.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Expression of negative emotions<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It should be of no surprise that intimacy is important in a romantic relationship. Being able to open up about negative emotions and address both relationship and personal problems to your partner can be a key factor in developing intimacy and closeness in a relationship.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5 </sup></span><span class=\"s1\">Like mentioned earlier, socially anxious individuals fear rejection and negative evaluation.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>2</sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">People with greater social anxiety are likely to self-disclosure less in a relationship due to the risk of potentially getting hurt.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>6</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> They are also more likely to avoid the expression of negative information in an effort to protect themselves and avoid relationship problems.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5 </sup></span><span class=\"s1\">This may be bothersome to you because you want to show your partner that they can come to you for anything and that they should feel safe to express their negative emotions. Surprisingly, allowing your socially anxious partner to withhold negative emotions can actually be beneficial to your relationship.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Because of the extreme of self-doubt and social fear that socially anxious people experience, encouraging them to express their negative emotions can resolve in greater avoidance, more complaining, and more need for reassurance. These factors can spark increased distress and negative behavior in the non-anxious partner. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Eventually, this causes disconnection and decrease in relationship satisfaction.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span> <span class=\"s3\">On the other hand, less negative emotional expression can enhance closeness in a relationship.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5 </sup></span><span class=\"s1\">Give your partner time and space; do not force your partner to discuss their feelings before than they are willing. With time, they will feel more comfortable with you and will eventually open more up about their negative emotions. Due to their social anxiety, it may take more time than for others.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Failure to recognize capitalization support</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Any partner’s ability to positively respond to the good news of their significant other to amplify their happiness can be a key determining factor of well-being and satisfaction in a relationship.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> If you are in a relationship with a socially anxious person, you may feel like you are not receiving enough support or enthusiastic responses from your partner when you experience positive events and share with them good news. Also, you may feel like your partner’s appreciation of your efforts of providing them support is low.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This can lead to significant relationship dissatisfaction. It is likely that you feel like your socially anxious partner’s non-supportive behaviors are due to jealousy or a problem they have with you, but in fact this may be the result of their social anxiety.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Individuals high in social anxiety are more likely to fail to recognize when and how to give proper supportive responses. They may also have problems processing enthusiastic support received from their partner.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3 </sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Now that you know that your partner’s behavior is not because of their problem with you, you can approach the situation differently. Instead of being angry or upset, start by helping your partner recognize the positive situations. Make a list that contains both positive and negative situations. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Then, sit down with your partner and walk them through the situations and ask them how they would react to each situation: happy, sad, angry, or no reaction. This gives you an overview of the situations your partner is failing to recognize. From there, you can help your partner read the social cues better and help them reactions that may be better fit the situation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>However, we don’t expect you to become your partner’s therapist!</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Using depreciation as a self-defensive mechanism</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another feature of socially anxious behavior in a romantic relationship is a tendency to put-down their partner as a self-defensive mechanism. Socially anxious individuals are more likely to perceive any little negative interaction in a relationship as a potential risk of rejection. When they feel like a threat of rejection is present, they often protect themselves by devaluing their partner.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>6</sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Examples of devaluing could be suddenly treating their partner with less respect, being angry or pretending not to care about them or the relationship. These actions can be very hurtful for you and may push you away. You should try your best to remain physically and mentally present and not let it bother you. It will show your partner that you want to stay in the relationship and that whatever negative interaction you had does not define the relationship and your feelings about them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Conclusion</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now you have read about some of the problems that an individual with social anxiety could face in a romantic relationship. This information should give you a better understanding of the nature of some relationship problems you might have that may be overwhelming and causing you distress or frustration. Understanding that these behaviors are normal for socially anxious individuals and not purposely done by your partner to upset you is an important reminder. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Maintaining a romantic relationship with an individual with mental health problems will often be more demanding, you may have to be more aware of your actions and understanding of the range of difficulties your partner has to deal with. To enhance relationship satisfaction, encourage your partner to seek out professional therapy to help them learn the best techniques to minimize and deal with their social anxiety. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, as we’ve discussed, you also have a lot of control over your relationship with your partner even if they don’t seek therapy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>As best you can, try to be patient and careful in communication when expressing negative emotions. Also, remember to show your partner that you’re in this together – and that you’ll be there for them. </span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3,5,6</sup></span></p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">Social anxiety disorder.

Cohabitation (defined as living with a romantic or sexual partner without being married) has become more popular, with 59% of American adults having lived with a partner before marriage</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. There is research showing cohabitation leads to more problems with marriage, including divorce</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>2</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. While these studies are scary for those looking to move in with their partner, the research also shows that there are factors that put some couples at more risk than others. Moving in together is a big decision and having a conversation about it is important. </span><span class=\"s3\">This post will focus on how you and your partner can navigate such a complex decision and what the relationship looks like moving forward.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">Questions to Ask Yourself and Your Partner</span><span class=\"s1\">:</span></h2>\n<h3><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Would this be the first time you or your partner have lived with a romantic partner?</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Living with a partner is an exciting step in a relationship and may be uncharted territory for some. While having experience living with a partner may bring comfort, those who have lived with a romantic partner prior to living with their spouse are more likely to have their marriage end in divorce</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. While the reason is unclear, research shows the higher the number of partners a person has lived with, the higher the chances of getting a divorce</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. If this is your (and your partner’s) first time living with a romantic partner, your chances of a successful relationship are better than if it’s your second or third partner</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>3</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Are you in a “stay-over” relationship?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">A stay-over relationship is a relationship where one person spends several nights a week at their partner’s place</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. These relationships are fun and a great way to spend time together while maintaining your own space. However, keep in mind that stay-over relationships can cause issues if there is confusion on what the next steps are</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Having a conversation about the long-term living situation can be a way to clear up that confusion. When couples decide to move in together, it can add a sense of certainty that may not have been there before</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Couples who are happy with a stay-over relationship and have discussed the future of the relationship are fine if they continue to communicate about expectations for the future. Some couples may find the decision to live together comforting as a confirmation of the relationship status and future</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Are you “deciding” to live together instead of “sliding”?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">The idea of “sliding” has to do with a slow increase in commitment to the relationship</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. It often goes unnoticed and feels like a pressure to move on to the next step</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Clothes in a drawer turn into a shared closet and before they know it the realization sets in that a couple is living together</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>6</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. While many may experience this slow transition into cohabitation, making the decision together ensures everyone is on the same page about the relationship</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. When “deciding” to move in together, both partners are aware of what to expect and can plan for different relationship outcomes</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Sometimes sliding into a relationship can lead to one or both partners feeling trapped and unable to leave the relationship</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>7</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Keep this in mind when considering the next question.</span></p>\n<h3><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>If you are planning on sharing resources, can these resources be separated in the event the relationship ends?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Sharing resources goes together with “sliding” into a relationship</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. As a couple goes from having a drawer at the other’s home to sharing the entire living space, it is easy to see how it can be difficult to determine what belongs to whom</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. An example of this is getting a pet or having a baby together. An unhappy couple may stay together solely for the pet or child</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>7</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. If the relationship ends, the difficult decision of who keeps the pet or who has custody of the child must be made. To add another layer of complexity, financial dependence on a partner makes it harder for the couple to break up if they are unhappy</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>8</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. While uncomfortable to think about, discussing how to split resources if the relationship does end is an important part of planning to move in together.</span></p>\n<h3><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Do you and your partner have the same long-term/marriage goals?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">For many couples, marriage is an important step of a relationship and the ultimate goal</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>2</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. While some may see living together as a step towards marriage, not everyone has the same set of beliefs</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>2</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Therefore, having a discussion of both partner’s goals in the relationship is crucial. For couples living together, those that do see marriage as an important step tend to be happier than the ones that don’t care about marriage or try to delay it</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>9</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Couples who are engaged when they move in together also tend to be happier and are less likely to divorce</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>8</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Additionally, most couples who are not engaged when living together tend to feel uncertain about at least one aspect of the relationship, particularly whether the relationship will last</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>10</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Couples should discuss their beliefs on marriage and long-term relationship goals before deciding whether to make a commitment about moving in together.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Are you moving in for reasons other than testing the relationship?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Partner compatibility is the third most common concern in relationships, which explains why many couples live together just to test the relationship</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>10</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Testing a relationship is when a couple hopes that moving in together will provide clarity on whether marriage is a good idea and whether it will solve existing problems</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>11</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. These couples are less confident and have less commitment to their partner</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>11</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. In comparison, couples with fewer problems while dating are more likely to marry; this is likely due to the increased confidence from not having the need to test the relationship through cohabiting</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>11</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Testing the relationship is a problem not only because the relationship is more likely to end, but because moving in together adds constraints that make it difficult to leave the relationship (as discussed in questions 3 and 4)</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. To summarize: don’t move in to test the relationship.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s5\">Conclusion</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Moving in together is an extremely personal decision between you and your partner where there is no right or wrong answer. Hopefully, by raising these questions, you and your partner will be able assess the state of the relationship and the ultimate goals you each seek. Having this assessment will allow you to make informed decisions on the future course you wish the relationship to take. Remember to consider your own well-being as an individual when asking these questions as they serve not only to improve upon great relationships, but also prevent from getting into or staying in those which are unhealthy. If the relationship is not going well or if there are questions about the next steps, moving in together probably won’t make things better. In the end, do what you think is best for your overall happiness.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s5\"><b>What’s your risk score?</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If you answered </span><span class=\"s5\"><b>yes</b></span><span class=\"s1\"> to:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li8\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>5-6 Questions = Low Risk<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li8\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Give it a shot! </b>Moving in may be a good thing for the relationship. Remember to keep having regular check-ins with yourself and your partner.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li9\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>3-4 Questions = Medium Risk<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li9\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Sleep on it. </b>Moving in may or may not be the right next step at this moment. You might have a few more steps to take before you and your partner are ready, but keep giving the decision and relationship some thought.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li10\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>0-2 Questions = High Risk</b></span>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li10\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Hold your horses. </b>Moving in can wait. You and your partner may need to have a few conversations before the decision of living together is on the table. You might want to reevaluate the relationship all together and whether it is a relationship you want to continue.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">References</span></p>\n<p class=\"p11\"><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Graf, N.

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p><strong>By Salena Fortich</strong></p>\n<p>Increasingly, couples have to deal with some sort of long-distance arrangement at some point during the relationship. It is estimated that 3 million Americans live apart from their spouses for reasons unrelated to conflict or separation.</p>\n<p>The number of long-distance relationships is even higher amongst younger couples. Up to 75% of college students have been in a long-distance relationship at some point. Long distance relationships have the potential to generate downstream psychological effects related to physical separation such as concerns regarding loyalty, fidelity, and commitment to the relationship.</p>\n<p>A key to maintaining a healthy and positive relationship is focusing on staying connected and intimate! Below are a few tips to help you navigate your long-distance relationship:</p>\n<h2><strong>Have a Routine of Daily Communication</strong></h2>\n<p>It isn’t a surprise that the greater distance and time between visits puts additional strains on relationships and leads to poorer relationship outcomes. However, technological advancement in the past few decades has increased mutual and immediate availability in communication in long-distance relationships.</p>\n<p>Although you may not be able to see your partner every day, there is a sense of security made possible by daily communication. Phones and computers allow partners to communicate across long distances and share many experiences to help mitigate the effect of physical distance.<sup>3 </sup>So, how does one develop a daily routine of communication?</p>\n<p>It is important to understand that intimacy in relationships is much more than sexual intimacy. Emotional intimacy is a key factor in maintaining positive long-distance relationships.<sup>4 </sup>Emotional intimacy is especially important in long-distance relationships where physical contact is limited.</p>\n<p>Couples in long-distance relationships should fill their time with texts or verbal conversations when they communicate with each other. It is important to talk about your everyday lives and to explore each other’s separate lives to help develop emotional intimacy.</p>\n<p>Making plans helps romantic partners to decrease the effects of uncertainty by creating structure and routines! Many couples engage in planning talk to help produce certainty about future face-to-face interactions.<sup>4</sup> These conversations can consist of making actual plans for when you’ll see each other again. For example, you and your partner can develop a plan for a date night out or an activity to have something to look forward to the next time you are with one another.</p>\n<p>When couples are apart, it is important to plan on having serious talks face-to-face via Facetime or other forms of video chats. Face-to-face communication – even when you’re not in the same room &#8211; allows for the most immediate and honest context. It also allows partners to feel more confident that they can understand one another when they are able to see facial expressions and body language.</p>\n<p>It is important to have a routine when it comes to talking on the phone or video chat but also make sure it doesn’t begin to feel like a chore. Sometimes over-communicating, either over the phone or through text, can become overbearing; therefore, it is important to find a happy medium that works for both partners schedules when they are away from each other.</p>\n<h2><strong>Set Clear Rules and Boundaries</strong></h2>\n<p>In any relationship, but especially those that are in long distance, setting boundaries is a key component to a healthy relationship. Boundaries allow you to establish expectations of what both you and your partner want in the relationship.</p>\n<p>It allows you both to explicitly state what you are and are not comfortable with in terms of both you and your partner’s actions.</p>\n<p>First, it is important to discuss the status of your relationship. Before physically separating and going long distances, it is important to make it clear what both partners expect out of the relationship. Confusion can come when you think you are in an exclusive relationship – but your partner doesn’t – when you two are apart.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether it’s a non-monogamous or monogamous relationship, it is important to establish both of your sexual expectations. By clarifying the nature of your relationship and holding the space to discuss this, you are allowing for a safe and intimate space.</p>\n<p>This is important to foster safety, commitment, and respect within your relationship.<br />\nIn setting rules and boundaries, you must make sure you trust one another and are open with communication.6 Social media is a great tool to stay in contact and get to understand your partner’s life away from you. But it also can be difficult to navigate at times.</p>\n<p>With the increased usage of social media and constantly posting, a common issue that arises in long-distance relationships is jealousy or insecurity. If you see a post or comment that may have made you question your relationship or feel yourself questioning it, it is important to speak up. It is easy when you are long-distance to let little things boil up. But it is important to communicate when certain actions bother you to avoid a snowballing effect.</p>\n<h2><strong>Do things together when you’re apart!</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges that come with long-distance relationships is the inability to share experiences together. While it is hard to be able to go on dates to a museum or to go to a stadium and watch a game, there are ways to try and maintain the novelty of dating. In today’s world, technology has greatly advanced the ways couples can interact even when they may be a couple of hundred miles away.</p>\n<p>Facetime and video chat help keep the face-to-face interaction and allows for planned virtual dates. Although you may not be able to physically go to a restaurant together, a great alternative is to share dinners over video chat.</p>\n<p>By pre-planning these virtual dinner dates, couples can see each other and get a sense of being together.</p>\n<p>Creating a sense of being together is important since this idea of shared living over video chat allows for couples to see each other’s reactions and get a better sense of how each person is doing. Doing so allows a dimension of empathy that cannot be received simply through text messages or even simple phone calls.</p>\n<p>Another idea of what to do together when you are apart is to plan to watch a show together. If a show plays live on TV every Monday, couples can plan to video chat and watch it together. This too, like the dinner dates, allows for each partner to feel more connected and get to experience the moment together. It is important to provide a sense of shared experiences with each other because it allows for growth in your relationship.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>Staying Intimate and Connected in Long Distance<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></h2>\n<p>If you find yourself in a long-distance relationship and are struggling, just remember you are not alone. Remember, it is okay to feel uncomfortable and uncertain when in a long-distance relationship. It is also normal to feel that your intimacy is dwindling when you are not geographically close. However, if you can have a routine and communicate daily, establish boundaries, and incorporate activities to share even when apart, your relationship will continue to progress in a healthy direction. These three tips alone will continue to grow and help maintain that intimacy in your relationship even when you are hundreds of miles away.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Learn More about How to Improve Your Relationship!</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\"><b>www.ourrelationship.com</b></a></p>\n",

You have just handed in your keys to your former apartment and moved in with your partner. You have taken a giant leap in your relationship and progressed to the next level. What happens next? In this post, we are going to help you navigate living together for the first time.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are numerous ways to refer to a couple moving in together such as shacking up, living together, or playing house, but researchers prefer to use the word <i>cohabitation</i>. Cohabitation is the rise with approximately 50% to 60% of couples in the United States deciding to live together before marriage</span><span class=\"s1\">. Many couples view cohabitation as a stepping stone to marriage; however, the likelihood of cohabiters transitioning to marriage is dependent upon education levels.</span>(Those more highly educated are more likely to get married after living together than are people with a lower level of education<sup>3</sup>.) <span class=\"s1\">Moving in together presents its own set of unique challenges from splitting chores, to divvying up rent, to figuring out how much time to spend together.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Additionally, couples living together report more physical aggression, increased frequency of sex, more negative communication, higher levels of commitment, and decreased relationship satisfaction when compared to couples that are just dating</span><span class=\"s1\">. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It may be tempting to move in together out of convenience or because you want to spend more time together; however, when couples move in together to test the relationship, it becomes problematic</span><span class=\"s1\">. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Regardless of all the external factors, it’s important to make a conscious decision that moving in together is the right next step for your relationship. If not, it may not be all rainbows and butterflies like you had hoped. However, this does not mean that your relationship is doomed just because you decided to live together. Below are some tips to consider:</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Determine whether you decided or slid into moving in together</b>. </span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There can be all kinds of reasons to move in together — your lease is up, you spend so much time at your partner’s place anyway, you’ll both save money, your roommate just moved out. The issue is that, instead of making a conscious decision about living together, many couples just let it happen &#8211; which is called sliding. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the other hand, deciding is making an informed decision to live with your significant other after having a conversation about the goals and the reasons for cohabiting. After you have moved in together, there may be plenty of reasons that make it harder to break up—what researchers call constraints.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When people slide into relationship transitions, they may start building constraints before they have a chance to think about whether they want to be committed or dedicated to this person and this relationship</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>4</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">. Since you are already living with your partner, just take the time to sit down together and ensure that you are on the same page as to what your long-term relationship goals are. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Moving forward, it is also better to avoid taking on things together that might make it harder to end a relationship (even if you are no longer wanting to stay in the relationship) such as a dog, a joint bank account, or a child. By not having any constraints, you are able to cut ties if it does not work out without feeling like you are in too deep or stuck.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span><span class=\"s1\"><b>Take time-outs to improve negative communication</b>. </span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As I mentioned earlier, negative communication often increases once couples move in together. So, when you are trying to communicate with your partner and it seems to be going awry (specifically if you are getting heated or frustrated with each other), take a time-out instead of continuing to go around in circles without being productive</span><span class=\"s1\">. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The period for a time-out can range from 20 minutes to 24 hours, but not more than that so that it does not seem like you are trying to avoid talking with your partner. During the time-out, do not keep the fight alive in your head by ruminating over it. Instead, watch your favorite show, read that book that has been sitting on your shelf for months, take a nap, meditate, or take a soothing bath. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After the time-out is over, talk things through with your partner in a calm manner, repair any damage that was sustained, and apologize for any hurtful things that may have been said or done. By taking time to regroup and think rationally, both of you will be more willing to understand the point of view of the other person which decreases the likelihood of yelling and insulting each other. If there is less negative communication, then you will have a more productive discussion and a more positive experience.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Engage in novel activities together. </b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even though moving in together with your other (and perhaps better) half means you get to spend more time together, how that time is spent is crucial. According to studies, when couples just Netflix and chill or go to dinner at the same restaurant, or fall into other routines, relationship satisfaction decreases</span><span class=\"s1\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s4\">To avoid</span><span class=\"s1\"> falling into the same rut, share new experiences together by engaging in novel activities such as dancing, a weekend getaway, getting a scuba certification, or cooking a different cuisine together</span><span class=\"s1\">. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You could even take this a step further by trying out an unfamiliar activity in bed which can range from acting out a sexual fantasy to trying a new position or using a toy. By enjoying exciting and arousing endeavors together, you will feel closer to each other, which leads to higher levels of relationship satisfaction.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While moving in together poses its own set of challenges, it is also a unique opportunity to truly get to know and have fun with your partner. Living together is also a great chance to get to know yourself and your own triggers. As you are testing out the waters for yourself, the tips mentioned in the blog post are the top three things you can do to reduce the adverse effects that moving in together before getting engaged seems to have. Which of these tips stuck out the most to you? Which one are you most excited to implement with your partner? By giving any of the tips a try, moving in with the love of your life might just be the best decision you have ever made.</span></p>\n<p>Learn more about the OurRelationship program today:</p>\n<div class=\"vid_frame\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GIHQkpf0bs\"><p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\">OurRelationship®</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;OurRelationship®&#8221; &#8212; OurRelationship\" src=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/embed/#?secret=GIHQkpf0bs\" data-secret=\"GIHQkpf0bs\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n",

Try things you’ve never done before &#8211; if you don’t like it, encourage your partner to change what they&#8217;re doing.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">Step 5</span><span class=\"s1\">: Sensual intercourse</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Finally, you and your partner can engage in intercourse.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The goal of this step is NOT to have an orgasm (although it’s totally okay if you do!!), but rather, the goal is to feel connected to your partner and find what feels good for you.</span></p>\n<h2><i></i><span class=\"s1\">Practice mindfulness on your own and/or during sexual interactions</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Practicing mindfulness alone has been found to reduce shame and increase acceptance of traumatic events.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Here’s how to get started:</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>1</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Take a seat &#8211; If you are sitting in a chair put both feet on the floor and rest your hands on your lap.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>If you are sitting on the floor, find a comfortable position</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Set a time limit &#8211; Start with just 5 minutes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You can always build this up, but do not force yourself to engage in this for too long the first time.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Notice the different sensations in your body &#8211; Are your shoulders by your ears? Are you clenching your jaw?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Try to notice any areas of tension and give yourself permission to relax them even if it’s just for the 5 minutes of mindfulness.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Feel and focus on your breath &#8211; Imagine you’re sending your breath into different areas of your body.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It may be helpful to inhale for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, and repeat.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Notice when your mind wanders &#8211; The whole point of mindfulness is to let your mind wander, and you simply observe the thoughts.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Imagine a stream of water where your thoughts are leaves floating down the stream.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Some move faster than others; nonetheless, just let the thoughts float by without judging them</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kindly invite your mind back to your breath &#8211; When your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breath.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Speak to yourself the way you would someone you love and bring your attention back to your inhales and exhales.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Using mindfulness while you are having sex can help you stay present in the moment and actually leads to a more enjoyable sex life (with more orgasms!!) and subsequently, higher relationship satisfaction.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>11</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> The key is to focus your attention on whatever is bringing you pleasure.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Here are some ideas to get you started:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">The feeling of your partner’s fingertips on your skin</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Your partner’s breathing pattern &#8211; you may even match their breathing</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Focus on what you see, hear, taste, smell, and feel.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Engage all your senses</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Are you ready to involve your partner by practicing sensate focus or discussing sexual likes and dislikes? Or would you rather take an independent approach and try mindfulness for a couple minutes?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>These options can be a great way to start cultivating a more positive relationship with yourself, your partner, and sex.</span></p>\n",

Whether it is with your children, friends, or partner, vulnerability helps us get to know the people in our lives and really connect to them. There are many hurdles we must face to becoming emotionally intimate—whether its building trust, becoming self-aware, or having difficult self-reflection or conversations. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">However, without vulnerability, we would not reach intimacy &#8211; and this would lead to relationships that feel superficial and dry. With intimacy comes conversations, love, understanding, a better sex life, and many more emotions that build in an intimate relationship.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you feel like your relationship lacks depth and real conversation? Are you trying to find a way to be emotionally vulnerable with your partner and open up in a way you did not before? Did you know that, simply by communicating positively with your partner, your relationship is more likely to feel fulfilled by both you and your significant other?</span><span class=\"s1\"> Here are some tips to help be emotionally vulnerable in your relationship.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>To improve conflict resolution, be mindful and accepting of your partner’s feelings.</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Healthy expression of one’s own emotions includes both positive and negative feelings during a discussion.</span><span class=\"s1\"> This contributes to better self-acceptance, personal growth, and interpersonal intimacy.</span><span class=\"s1\"> In a discussion, you can attempt to be aware of your partners’ feelings and seek to maintain a safe environment. An example of this could be when you notice your partner is upset; you can tell them &#8220;Even though we are arguing, I still love you” or try to crack a joke about the situation to ease some tension. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If your partner feels threatened or anxious, be aware that they can begin to place or take the blame &#8211; causing them to revert to past responses which tend to not be useful in conflict resolution. By observing your significant other’s emotions, you can notice that your partner is becoming detached. Your partner can become quiet, not wanting to talk, walk out in the middle of a discussion, and find other ways to isolate themselves. Be empathetic about your partner&#8217;s feelings without judging or pushing them away. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Your partner may feel one way, but they’re suppressing how they feel or becoming emotionally distant.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>However, if you become distant, they are even more likely to pull away. This prevents conflict resolution and increases the likelihood that the argument will arise again.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>In a heterosexual relationship, men are least likely to be emotionally vulnerable. Men are taught to mistrust strong emotions, such as crying because they are seen as a weakness.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Thus, you should be vigilant about how your partner feels. You can offer new ways to respond in your relationship if you are aware your significant other tends to mask emotional vulnerability to improve conflict resolution. If you notice your partner is upset, ask them “tell me how you feel”, or you can suggest: “do you want to talk about it?” to ease into a difficult or stressful conversation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> If you notice the argument seems to be escalating and hurtful words could be said, say “I think we should relax and discuss this later when we aren’t as upset”. This gives your partner time to relax and not act out in anger.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It also gives them time to think through the argument, and what to say with a calm and collected mind.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Speaking in a calm moment rather than in anger improves conflict resolution and overall discussions. In an intense dispute, the person with less power may respond in reactive ways to appear powerful to mask their sense of vulnerability.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Try to remember your partner may need a moment to relax or they can be feeling very vulnerable and not know the best way to express themselves.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Have frequent meaningful conversations.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Discuss with your partner your insecurities and fears. Share positive and negative childhood memories that impacted how you view relationships today. If your partner experienced parental divorce, they are more likely to favor attitudes toward divorce and can even reduce commitment in relationships.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Meaningful conversations lead to a relationship that is built on honesty rather than ambiguity. By having open and judgment-free conversations, the other partner feels more inclined to discuss topics that they were scared to mention before and begins to feel safe in the relationship. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This leads to a relationship that is emotionally vulnerable and connected. Allow your partner to share past relationship issues since this can influence insecurities in your current relationship. Early adults’ own experience with instability impacts expectations for future relationships.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If your partner had a previously abusive relationship, understand that trust in your relationship will take more time to build. If your significant other had a difficult past regarding family issues or their love lives, your partner requires compassion, and their past can lead to positive conversations in which you can reassure your partner to build trust. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Reassuring your partner of their fears and doubts becomes easier and more frequent when you know about them. Reassurance also causes your partner to feel validated which could be most useful for individuals from previously abusive relationships. Discuss aspects that make each of you in the relationship feel safe and secure. If your partner had a previously toxic, jealous, or controlling partner, they may require more space in this relationship, and discussing this with your partner sets a more considerate expectation of each other.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Have satisfying sex.</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Sexual satisfaction often has an important role in determining the level of emotional intimacy in relationships.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>5</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Men consider a satisfactory sexual relationship as a tool for increasing emotional intimacy, whereas women may pursue emotional intimacy to feel sexually intimate with their partners.</span><span class=\"s1\"> You can spice up the bedroom to fulfill your and your partner&#8217;s needs by changing up your sex life. Try new sexual positions, or fantasies which you have discussed with your partner previously but did not due for whatever reason. Communicating about your sex life to make it more pleasurable also increases the likelihood that you and your partner view your sex life as enjoyable. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Discuss what both of you enjoy or dislike in the bedroom. Having safe words when you or your partner feel out of control can help in a situation to stop or take a break. Safe words can ease your worries when trying something new that makes either of you nervous or cautious. Partners are more likely to feel emotionally and sexually intimate with their partners when they perceive that their partner’s communication style is more positive, and this increases intimacy and enhances their relationship satisfaction.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> When both partners feel their sex life is satisfactory, they are more likely to view the relationship as satisfactory as well. There should be no stigmas involved in your relationship when discussing sex; both partners should feel comfortable and able to discuss what they like, dislike, and their boundaries.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">These are three things you can do to become or help your partner be more emotionally vulnerable in the relationship. Starting with an honest, heartfelt conversation with your partner can be a great start. How will you incorporate these tips into your life? Are there some tips you might already be successfully doing now? Which tip sounds more difficult for either your partner or even yourself? Just one of these tips can help you feel more secure and initiate and lead to better conversations in your relationship today!

If you are reading this blog post, it’s probably because your partner cheated and you’re hoping to somehow rebuild your marriage. You are not alone. Couple therapists report that infidelity is one of the most damaging issues that couples can face.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Approximately 22-25% of men and 11-15% of women admit to having extramarital sex at least once during their marriage.</span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">You may feel lost, but there are essential steps that can be taken to repair the damage and restore the relationship. They will take great effort not just from your partner but from you too! In this post, we will be walking through five key tips on how to rebuild your marriage after an affair.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Refrain from making hot-headed decisions and seeking revenge.</b><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">When we are angry or hurt, we respond with angry feelings to feel less vulnerable and tend to make decisions without thinking them through as much. The desire to get revenge is common but acting on it is not healthy for you and will not bring anything positive to you or your relationship. In fact, it can do more damage &#8211; which will make recovering from the affair even more difficult. Sending angry texts to your significant other, contacting the person they cheated with (or that person’s partner), or bad-mouthing your partner to your children will just hurt you and make matters worse. If you are willing to make it work, focus on the steps that can be taken to make things better.</span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Choose to trust again.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Simply put, if you want to rebuild your relationship, you must relearn to trust your</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">partner: it is the only way. It is important to let go of whatever is out of your control. You cannot control your significant other or the people around them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Indeed, if you are willing to give them another chance, then you need to accept the fact that there is nothing you can do besides <i>trust </i>them. Think of trust as a conscious choice &#8211; one that acts as a solid base to a successful marriage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> You will not magically begin trusting your partner overnight, of course. Dr. Kennon V. Rider, a licensed psychologist who specializes in marriage and family therapy, provides her patients with a clever metaphor to help them understand the process of restoring trust.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Suppose that you must drive on the highway to get to work every morning. She suggests that if you are willing to get into a car and drive on the highway daily, it is because you implicitly trust that the other drivers will stay in their lanes and drive how they are supposed to. However, suppose one day another driver swerves into your lane and smashes into your car. Your car is totaled, and you are injured. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">After going to the hospital, you return home to heal. Finally, the day arrives when you must return to work in your new car. It is very hard, but you care a lot about that job and decide you want to keep it. Therefore, you will need to relearn how to trust the other drivers on the highway. On the way to work, you will probably be very cautious and keep a sharp eye on the other lanes, but eventually, you will realize that you cannot control the drivers – all you can control is your own driving. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you repeatedly get to work safely, you’ll be grateful and relieved. After some time, trusting the drivers will become easier.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Now think of the accident as infidelity; the driver that crashed into you is your partner. You will have to go through the same process of choosing to trust and letting go of what you cannot control. As time passes and your partner focuses on “staying in their lane”, trusting your significant other will become easier.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Reflect on what factors played a role in the occurrence of the affair.</b><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">To be clear: No matter the circumstances, having an affair is wrong. Unfortunately, it often happens, and many different factors can lead to it. A common way of treating infidelity in couple therapy is by helping couples understand how factors outside of their relationship &#8211; and even things inside of it that they could have contributed to &#8211; played a role in the affair.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">High stress, neglect, stagnant sex life, constant arguing, and overall low relationship satisfaction can lead individuals to cheat. It is important to remember that these issues don’t justify the affair; it is not your fault that they cheated. However, being honest with yourself and reflecting on how your own actions, as well as certain external factors, could have influenced the affair can allow you to forgive and mend the relationship by working on these issues.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Identifying things that you can change in your own behavior is the only way to have direct control over whether this happens again. If you felt like your sex life was lacking before the affair, for example, it may be a good idea to schedule moments during the week to strengthen your sexual intimacy and recapture some of the spark you had when you first got together.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Have a weekly date night with your partner.</b><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> As the two of you try to rebuild your relationship, remind yourself and your partner why the relationship is worth saving! Reserve one day out of the week to dress up and go somewhere nice – just you and your partner. Engage in spontaneous and novel activities with your partner, such as trying new restaurants, going dancing, or taking an art class. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Avoid talking about the affair, therapy, work, and other stressors of everyday life; these topics can be discussed at another time. Try to keep the conversation light, as it is helpful to take a break from constant worry and frustration.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>6</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> Although it may feel awkward and forced at first, use this time to explore your new relationship together. Make date night a priority!</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\"><b>Work on your communication.</b><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> You&#8217;re upset. That’s okay and understandable. Discovering your partner’s betrayal was probably an emotionally traumatic event since it violated your basic relationship assumptions.</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>7</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> However, in moments of conflict, communication is key. The way you express yourself can change the direction and tone of a conversation. You and your significant other need to establish a “language” to be able to communicate transparently. You should focus on expressing the loss and trauma experienced due to the affair.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It is okay to go into depth about how you feel, but don’t go “on and on”. Use brief statements to not overwhelm your partner with too many thoughts at once. Also, stop periodically after you make a point. Pause to let your partner paraphrase, or summarize, and process what you just told them, and paraphrase when they pause for you. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Additionally, avoid blaming statements with “you”, such as “you are not affectionate”, and instead start them with “I”, such as “I don’t feel desired”. Using “you” statements will make your significant other feel attacked and more likely to become defensive. “I” statements will keep the focus on how you feel and what the main issue is, allowing both of you to brainstorm about what can be done to resolve it. When your partner is speaking, listen. As much as you want to interrupt, don&#8217;t. If turns to speak aren’t respected, the conversation will go nowhere. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Moreover, don’t mindread &#8211; in other words, don’t tell your significant other what they are thinking, wanting, or feeling. Focus on speaking for yourself. Lastly, avoid rebutting &#8211; instead of focusing on your reaction to your partner’s points, focus on listening and understanding what is being said.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>So, they cheated but you decided to give your marriage a second chance…<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you follow these 5 tips based on research and expert advice, you will be on the right track to restoring your marriage after infidelity. As explained above, reestablishing a healthy partnership requires openness to give and receive from your partner. Avoiding rash decisions, choosing to trust, accepting responsibility, prioritizing date night, and effective communication are the secret weapons of relationship restoration after an affair. However, these things are easier said than done. They may take time, and it may even be helpful to seek professional help. The light at the end of the tunnel might be dim right now, but this process may bring you and your partner closer than ever. It won’t be easy, but it will be worth it.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

Therefore, if you increase the level of emotional intimacy in your relationship, there is a possibility that these factors can improve with it and result in overall relationship satisfaction. So, <i>how </i>can you improve yours?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p11\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip#1: </b>Open Communication</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">Open communication means trying to speak clearly about the things that make you and your partner uncomfortable</span><span class=\"s1\">. This tip is essential to increasing levels of emotional intimacy in a relationship. Implementing open communication can help avoid future problems arising from perspectives on undisclosed or avoided topics</span><span class=\"s1\">. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, you can speak about things that you like or don’t like that your partner does, where you think the relationship stands, if you need space, etc. Another essential thing to speak about is boundaries and what you will or will not tolerate in the relationship, as well as listening to their opinion on the matter.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip #2: </b>Self-Disclosure </span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p14\"><span class=\"s1\">Aside from open communication, self-disclosure is imperative to increase emotional intimacy. One way that you can do this is by expressing your emotions to your partner and talking about pivotal experiences in your life. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p14\"><span class=\"s1\">If your partner does the same, make a conscious effort to be empathetic when they confide in you and show that you support and actively listen to them. This will help you feel connected to your partner on a deeper level, as well as make them feel that you trust them enough to disclose your feelings. As you share difficult experiences, even the small ones, there is a possibility that you will feel more emotionally connected to them and them to you</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>2</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip #3: </b>Capitalization </span></h2>\n<p class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s1\"><i><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></i></span><span class=\"s1\">The last important tip is capitalization. Essentially, capitalization is when good news is shared and celebrated with someone. As capitalization demonstrates a positive effect on relationships, show your partner that you care and are as excited as they are when they accomplish something</span><span class=\"s1\">. Show them that you are proud of them, and this will help them minimize feelings of discomfort and demonstrate to them that you think about them. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s1\">Celebrate each other’s victories and show each other how much you support one another. For example, if your partner gets accepted to the job of their dreams, you can celebrate with a romantic picnic, a trip, or something you have both been looking forward to doing. The message here is to show them that their accomplishments are as significant to you as they are to them, no matter how small or big they may seem.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Now that you understand the importance of emotional intimacy, the role it plays in your relationship, and some tips to improve it, what will you do?

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By <span class=\"s1\">Hadieh Zolfaghari</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you’re reading this blog post, then you’ve probably found the person who makes you the happiest, who you couldn’t imagine life without, and who you could see being your lifelong partner. You and this person come from different backgrounds, cultures, or races. Although you may not have anticipated it, these differences come with their own set of challenges as well as advantages. You may be starting to become aware of these challenges now, but don’t let them discourage you. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The increase in cultural diversity in the United States is causing intercultural romantic relationships (which can consist of partners from different religious, ethnic, racial, and/or language backgrounds) to become more and more common.</span><span class=\"s1\"> However, these relationships face higher levels of divorce and separation than intracultural relationships.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Despite their challenges, intercultural relationships create a unique environment in which people, such as you and your partner, have a lot to learn from each other and many ways to grow from the relationship. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So, how can you make these intercultural relationships work?</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip #1: Surround yourselves with people who support and accept your relationship.</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When couples experience feelings of stigmatization or marginalization due to their identity as an interracial couple, this causes them to feel as though they should not be together, adding extra stress to the relationship.</span><span class=\"s1\"> This also makes them more likely to view their cultural identity and couple identity as separate &#8211; sometimes causing them to feel as though they must choose between the two.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Therefore, you should prioritize having a social network that supports your relationship and does not cause you and your partner to feel intense feelings of stigmatization or marginalization. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can do this by putting in the effort to educate and enlighten your close friends and family so that they are able to support you and your relationship, as well as by living in an area with high levels of general acceptance of intercultural relationships. Developing resiliency skills to prepare you to face the social opposition that may occur because of your intercultural or interracial relationship will also protect and strengthen your relationship. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip #2: Be aware of, express, and respond to each other’s emotions by prioritizing communication.</b> </span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Couples who share similar emotional processes are more likely to have stronger relationships and higher relationship satisfaction because they are able to offer emotional support to each other in more effective ways.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Romantic partners with effective emotional exchanges are also more likely to report higher rates of intimacy, trust, and commitment.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Because you and your partner were raised with different cultural identities, the two of you have likely developed different values, beliefs, and norms. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These, in turn, lead to the development of different emotional processes. Because of this, you and your partner must engage in open communication to better understand these culturally influenced aspects of each other and have more effective emotional exchanges. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You and your partner should regularly set aside time to speak about your emotions, any issues that you are experiencing, and how these issues may relate to your cultural backgrounds. It may be helpful to schedule a time to talk about these topics. You should also be open to regulating and adjusting your own emotions to better support your partner’s emotions. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Effective communication skills will also allow for effective conflict resolution skills, which are a strong asset to intercultural and interracial relationships.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip #3: Develop an appreciation for your partner’s culture, even though it is different from your own. </b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As partners, you must be willing to celebrate and appreciate your differences and respective cultures in order to be open in your relationship.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In order to do this, you and your partner should dedicate time, effort, and energy towards learning about each other’s cultures, celebrating them, and engaging in the traditions, customs, and languages associated with them. You and your partner could celebrate each other’s cultural holidays, try to learn each other’s native languages, go to each other’s cultural celebrations and events, and even travel to each other’s countries of origin if possible. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This will allow you and your partner to feel seen and appreciated by each other in many cases. It will also allow for a stronger relationship with your partner’s family who shares the same cultural, racial, or ethnic identity &#8211; especially if this identity is an integral part of their lifestyle.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip #4: Try to understand the lived experience and identity of your partner, but don’t overestimate how much of their experience you are able to understand. </b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When intercultural relationships progress, couples often learn a lot about each other’s lived experiences, causing them to develop an understanding of their partner’s identity. Demonstrating an understanding of your partner facilitates more intimacy in relationships.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> However, the concept of developing and demonstrating an understanding of romantic relationships is complex.</span><span class=\"s1\"> When a person overestimates how well and how deeply they understand their partner and this overestimation exceeds their partner’s estimation of how understood they personally feel, this can lead to poorer relationship quality.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This poorer relationship quality consists of the partner feeling as though they are less cared for and viewing their partner more negatively.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It is important to work towards building an understanding of the ways in which your partner’s cultural and racial identity has affected their lived experiences. At the same time, it is also important not to assume that you fully understand every aspect of your partner’s identity and its implications. Intimate communication and vulnerability through the sharing of your cultural identities, your relationships with your cultures, and how your lived experiences have been influenced by your cultures will allow you and your partner to further develop your understanding of each other in a healthy way. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You and your partner should regularly set aside time to communicate about past and current experiences related to your culture, any discrimination that you have experienced, and how these experiences made you feel. You should also take a genuine interest in your partner’s lived experiences and do your best to respect and understand these experiences. However, you must remember that it is important not to overestimate your level of understanding. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although you have a close personal relationship with your partner, you have not personally experienced their lives and their culture. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tip #5: Develop and maintain a “we” mentality. </b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A “we” mentality refers to a mentality of unity between the partners of a romantic relationship and has proven to be a valuable method of promoting success in intercultural and interracial relationships. You and your partner should develop a united identity despite the differences in your ethnic and cultural backgrounds through aspects such as friendship, finding common ground, having similar goals, and commitment.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a couple, you can create a “we” mentality through friendship by allowing your friend</span><span class=\"s1\">s to bring you closer together despite your cultural differences.</span><span class=\"s1\"> You can do this by engaging in activities that remind you of your core friendship and by spending quality time together. Finding common ground within the differences that you experience as a couple will allow you to identify similarities that you can both relate to despite the differences that you may experience, also promoting relationship quality.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, two partners may have different ways of approaching problems yet share the same value system regarding problems in general. As a couple, you should find the common ground in the differences you experience and focus on the advantages that this common ground presents in your lives. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition, working toward similar goals will allow you two to focus on and use your strengths and feel as though you are a part of a unit, again supporting the “we” mentality.</span><span class=\"s1\"> You and your partner should identify common goals and work on them together as a team to accomplish this. Over time, increased commitment and ability to work effectively and positively alongside one another will also allow you to grow your united mentality.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>To wrap it up… </b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Intercultural and interracial romantic relationships pose a unique set of challenges that may be overwhelming and hard to navigate at first. But don’t let this scare you away from pursuing a relationship that could change your life in a positive way. Through your newfound knowledge and the guidance of these tips and skills, you now have the power to strengthen and preserve your own intercultural or interracial relationship. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Natalia Walcott</strong></p>\n<p>Every married couple remembers their honeymoon phase after their wedding. It probably involved frequent sex, lots of love and affection for each other, and a lack of arguments. However, once the honeymoon ends and life starts to settle in, you realize that marriage is not always going to be a fairy tale. Marriage takes a lot of hard work from both spouses. Sharing your life with someone else can be a big challenge but also offers many rewards. Here are twelve characteristics of successful marriages.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Communication</strong></h3>\n<p>Having good communication with your spouse is one of the most important things in a marriage. If you and your spouse have poor communication, you might have noticed that there is some trouble in paradise. Once you and your spouse start confronting each other with anger, tension, and hostility, it will cause communication to fail and a lack of listening and understanding to occur. However, not all communication is good communication &#8211; and not all disagreements are bad. In fact, one of the most damaging patterns of communication that couples get stuck in is a pursue-withdraw pattern, where one partner pushes for change or attention and the other partner withdraws or avoids discussing the issue. Being able to respectfully and effectively relay your feelings to your spouse without placing blame upon them is key.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Admiration and Respect</strong></h3>\n<p>Everyone wants to be respected and appreciated for who they are &#8211; especially by their spouse. Having support from your spouse means everything. Try to support your spouse’s achievements, help build up their self-esteem, and fulfill their emotional needs. Make sure you respect their individual differences as much as you respect their similarities to you; after all, differences can be sources of excitement and novelty in a relationship.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Companionship</strong></h3>\n<p>Make sure that both of you are making time for each other. Spend some quality time enjoying each other&#8217;s company by doing activities together that you both enjoy. If you want more ideas on fun things you can do, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/the-importance-of-date-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">read this post</a>. However, also take some time apart and hang out with other friends. Having space from your spouse and doing your own thing will make those special date nights together feel even more meaningful.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Spirituality and Values</strong></h3>\n<p>Having a shared sense of spirituality and values can be helpful in a marriage. Your faith can give you emotional, social, and spiritual support. Places of religious worship can be a source of friendships and activities for the couple to do together. Turning to your faith in times of hardship has offered spouses guidance in making important decisions regarding their marriage.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Commitment</strong></h3>\n<p>In order to make the marriage work, you both must be committed to each other. Marital sustainment is more attainable if the commitment is mutual. Marriage is not easy. It has its ups and downs, and in order to overcome those obstacles, a certain level of effort is required. If you have kids involved, commit to keeping the family together by putting in effort with your relationship with your spouse.</p>\n<h3><strong>6. Affection</strong></h3>\n<p>Make sure you are showing your spouse affection, whether that be mentally or physically. You should know their love language by now (if not, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/the-complete-guide-to-the-different-love-languages-and-what-they-mean/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here</a> to check out one of our earlier posts on this topic). Whether it be words of affirmation of or physical touch, make sure you fulfill your spouses need for affection and intimacy. Don’t forget to make time to have sex with your spouse. Meet each other’s sexual needs and try to spice things up from the usual bedroom routine (if you’re looking for some ideas, we wrote an earlier post on this too).</p>\n<h3><strong>7. Ability to Deal with Crises and Stress</strong></h3>\n<p>Nobody goes through life without facing some challenges. When you said, “I do,” you signed up to be there for your spouse “for better or for worse.” What sets spouses apart is how they can resolve their problems and manage stress in a constructive way. Whether you are faced with a personal issue or an issue as a couple, you should address it with your spouse in a healthy way. Work on having a greater tolerance with frustration and dealing with your anger. If necessary, take some space in order to process the crisis and stress. Try to not transfer your anger onto your partner. Remember that you both are a team and need to work together to fix your problems.</p>\n<h3><strong>8. Responsibility</strong></h3>\n<p>You both need to be able to take accountability for your roles and actions in the relationship, as well as your actions. In order for your marriage to be successful, make sure you are fair (which doesn’t necessarily mean equal) in how you divide responsibilities between you and your spouse. Putting most of the responsibilities onto your spouse &#8211; especially if you’re not taking on the majority of other types of responsibilities &#8211; will likely lead to them feeling overworked and underappreciated.</p>\n<h3><strong>9. Compassion</strong></h3>\n<p>There is no room for selfishness in a marriage. You cannot give 25% into your marriage yet expect 100% from your spouse. You both need to make it a priority to unselfishly attend to your partner’s needs as well as your own. Try to focus on “we” more than “I” or “you” – you’re a team and sometimes will need to put the needs of the team first.</p>\n<h3><strong>10. Empathy and Sensitivity</strong></h3>\n<p>As a spouse, you need to be able to identify with your spouse’s feelings, thoughts, and attitudes. Being able to listen to your partner confide in you, verbally express your support for them, and show how much you empathize with their feelings and emotions is necessary in having a successful marriage. There is a lot of evidence suggesting that emotional intimacy grows through the process of one person sharing vulnerable emotions with their partner and having their partner support them. So, try to share with your partner – and attend to them when they’re sharing with you. Those are really important moments. You don’t want to miss them.</p>\n<h3><strong>11. Honesty, Trust, and Fidelity</strong></h3>\n<p>Having the ability to trust your spouse without hesitation is one of the best feelings. You know that when they say they will do something; they will follow through with it. Knowing that your spouse is dependable and faithful to you creates peace and satisfaction in your marriage. Once trust is broken, it can be hard to build it back up. However, do not lose hope if that is the case for your marriage. Displaying remorse and making an effort to show your spouse that you care about them and want the marriage to work is a good first step in building back the trust. For more tips, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/your-partner-doesnt-trust-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">read this post</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>12. Adaptability, Flexibility, and Tolerance</strong></h3>\n<p>You and your spouse are likely not the same people that you were on your wedding day. As your marriage has progressed, the dynamics of it may have changed, and you must be able to adapt to these changes. Embrace who you and your spouse have become and continue building from there. Along those same lines, accept that the two of you will disagree sometimes – your different people after all! It is important to not adopt a “my way or the highway” type of approach. Being able to talk it out and come to a compromise is important.</p>\n<p>We know that it’s a tall order. Relationships are complex and can feel like a lot of work sometimes. But research shows that having a happy relationship is also one of the most important things we can do to have an overall happy life. So, it’s worth the effort!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Natalia Walcott</strong></p>\n<p>Love is both hard to define and a central part of most of our lives. There is no concrete definition of love that fits for everyone &#8211; our different perspectives of love come from our experiences and background. Love can be a feeling or emotion that you have for someone or it could be your actions towards them. Regardless of your personal definition, having intimate relationships with people that we love is important. These relationships matter because they are unique experiences that can’t be replicated. To love and to be loved are basic human needs. Most people would dread the thought of going through life’s journeys alone. Being lonely and socially isolated never feels good – a fact vividly illustrated by lockdowns due to the COVID pandemic. It’s in our nature to foster connections with others. When times are hard, we look towards those who we know love and care for us for comfort and guidance. It is through these interactions with others and our environment that we truly get to learn about ourselves. Without these intimate relationships, we can’t fully grasp or appreciate all the experiences that have given our lives meaning, purpose, and value.</p>\n<p>Have you ever been having a bad day and a small gesture or word from somebody that you love changed your whole mood and brightened up your day? If you have, you know how special and powerful that feeling is. Having people in your life that know just how to comfort you when you are distressed is essential. That is just one of many examples of how relationships are essential to giving us emotional comfort and have a lasting impact on our daily lives. Believe it or not, we are biologically in tune with the people that we share an intimate bond with. Even the presence or touch from a loved one can comfort you in a stressful moment. There is even evidence that a hug from our partners after a stressful day can reduce the stress hormone (cortisol) levels in our blood for the rest of the evening. When you hold your partner’s hand, you’re affecting their nervous system by empowering them to stay strong despite the problem they’re facing. Researchers can even see beneficial changes in the brain (in an fMRI machine) when people get to hold their partner’s hand. Who would’ve thought that a simple grasp of a hand could hold so much power and exert so much influence? It’s no wonder that we feel so happy when this occurs.</p>\n<p>Relationships can bring about happiness in multiple ways. Whether it’s financial, sexual, or even health-wise, they have a significant impact on your well-being. The impact that loving someone else can have on you is shocking. It is important to understand the benefits of being in a relationship with someone you love.</p>\n<p>Intimate relationships can bring about happiness because of the positive effects they can have on your physical health. Studies have shown that those who are in happy relationships and can constructively resolve conflicts are less likely to get sick with the common cold after being exposed to the virus. Your heart and immune system are also stronger when you have less conflict and hostility in your relationship. Since you and your partner aren’t fighting, you’re experiencing less stress mentally and physically. Well at least just in your relationship. A stressful job or unforeseen circumstances can still come and negatively affect you. Have you ever seen/ met a couple that’s been married for 50+ years, still madly in love, and want to know how to achieve that within your own relationship? I know I have. Every relationship is different, but the benefits of a relationship with that type of longevity is consistent across spouses. Those in committed relationships live longer than those that are divorced or in an unhealthy relationship. All of that arguing and fighting isn’t good for you in the long run. You are also more likely to have support with life’s challenges because you have a partner helping you along the way.</p>\n<p>Intimate relationships also promote happiness through sexual intimacy. People say that sex is the activity that makes them the happiest. Being able to be physically close to your partner and connect on an intimate level is such a great feeling. If you are in a healthy relationship, you and your partner hopefully have a good and consistent sex life. However, if not, be sure to check out one of our recent blog posts <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/top-3-reasons-to-have-more-sex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Being in a stable and happy relationship also tends to benefit couples financially. Although being married costs more money, you and your partner are more likely to accumulate wealth than if you were single, separated, or divorced. It’s cheaper to have someone to share housing and other costs with. Also, being in a stable relationship tends to reduce careless or unnecessary spending and gets people thinking about saving for the future.</p>\n<p>Relationships can affect our subjective well-being. This can depend on the type of relationship you have with your significant other. You are more likely to be happier within your relationship when you are married, as opposed to being unmarried. However, not everyone in a relationship is happy. You probably have many single friends that are thriving and happy as can be despite not being in a relationship. It’s the quality of your relationship that really matters. This can be a bigger determining factor of your overall subjective well-being than your satisfaction with work, finances, friendship, health, etc. You might love your partner, but if your relationship is negatively affecting you, it might be time to have a conversation with your partner about your relationship moving forward.</p>\n<p>When your relationship is of high quality and endures the hardships and obstacles that you and your partner may face, happiness is sure to follow. Love plays a role in our everyday lives, whether it is with a partner, family member, or friend. Having someone that loves and supports you is an amazing feeling. The benefits of being in a healthy, loving relationship speak for themselves. Love matters so much. Try to foster meaningful relationships to not only improve your quality of life but to build memories that will last a lifetime!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Jennifer Mckinnon</strong></p>\n<p>Erectile dysfunction (or ED) is an uncomfortable topic to talk about. After all, what man wants to admit that they can’t get erect? Sometimes, the fear of being the butt of jokes is greater than the courage to be honest.</p>\n<p>If you’re suffering from ED, know that you’re not the only one facing this condition. Erectile dysfunction <a href=\"https://theenhancedmale.com/blogs/the-enhanced-males-knowledge-center/study-men-with-erectile-dysfunction-and-the-impact-on-their-lives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">affects over 30 million men</a> in the United States. Aside from the physical symptoms, ED causes feelings of decreasing confidence, shame, and inadequacy.</p>\n<p>With all that said, it can affect any <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4005452/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">relationship</a>—even long-lasting ones like marriages. How? Let’s find out.</p>\n<h2><strong>How It Starts</strong></h2>\n<p>Before getting to the main subject at hand, here’s an overview of how erectile dysfunctions happen to understand its impact better.</p>\n<p>Erections happen when blood continually flows through a person’s penis. Sexual thoughts or excitement or direct contact stimulates this said blood flow. When something wrong happens while the erection stage is happening, ED begins to manifest. Often, erectile dysfunction can be caused by an underlying medical condition, such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, etc.</p>\n<p>Possible symptoms can include erection troubles and decreased sexual desires. If you or your partner are experiencing these symptoms, you may want to consult a professional for assistance, especially if they’re frequently happening.</p>\n<h3><strong>Causes</strong></h3>\n<p>Erectile dysfunctions have several causes, which include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<h3><strong>Physical Factors</strong></h3>\n<p>Most ED cases come from physical factors. These are some of the typical causes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hypertension</li>\n<li>Sleep disorders</li>\n<li>Diabetes</li>\n<li>Drug use</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Psychological Factors</strong></h3>\n<p>The brain plays a role in causing erections. These mind-affecting factors can interfere with the erection process, laying the ground down for future dysfunctions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stress</li>\n<li>Anxiety</li>\n<li>Depression</li>\n<li>Relationship issues/problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>How EDs Can Affect Relationships</strong></h2>\n<p>Erectile dysfunction isn’t a sexy topic, which is why many chose to keep mum about their condition. The thought of not being able to get erect and satisfy their partners sexually brings men with ED a great deal of shame. This leads them to doubt themselves as partners or husbands, shutting themselves off out of fear.</p>\n<p>Men cope with the shame in various ways. Aside from closing themselves off, some end up blaming their partners for their erection problems. If you’re suffering from this, know better than to commit such a mistake.</p>\n<p>ED not only affects men, but women are impacted too. Women in these relationships wonder if their capabilities in the bedroom aren’t enough to satisfy their partner&#8217;s wants and needs. As this self-doubt grows, it may lead them to doubt their partner’s commitment and loyalty.</p>\n<p>A healthy amount of sex is essential in relationships. It’s more than just getting your dose of bodily pleasure. <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/105754-this-is-how-much-sex-is-normal-in-a-long-term-relationship-according-to-an-expert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sex connects partners on an intimate level.</a> “Sex is the glue that keeps us together and the spice that makes our joint life exciting,” says author and licensed couple’s therapist Laurie Watson.</p>\n<p>The psychological baggage that comes with EDs causes partners to walk on eggshells around each other and matters in the bedroom. The more you tiptoe around this issue, the worse your problems and frustrations will become. And if those problems aren’t solved, they will erode your relationship.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to Treat Erectile Dysfunction</strong></h2>\n<p>Fortunately, most cases of ED are temporary and treatable, especially if you address them early. You may want to look at these options to get rid of the problem:</p>\n<h3><strong>Open up and Talk about It</strong></h3>\n<p>Many men suffer from erectile dysfunctions. You’re not alone in facing this. Admitting and acknowledging it is hard, but it’s an essential step to curing the problem.</p>\n<p>Even though it’s 2021, toxic masculinity still prevents men from opening up about it since they don’t want to be shamed and laughed at by fellow men. So if anyone, even your closest friends, ridicules you and questions your masculinity for having ED, pay no mind to their insensitivity.</p>\n<p>One of the first things you can do is to be completely honest about it to your partner. If anyone can show you understanding and compassion, it’s your other half.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ask Help from Professionals</strong></h3>\n<p>Once you’ve cleared the air with your partner, you can seek help from experts. For relationship problems, approach a licensed counselor or therapist for assistance. Talking about ED’s effects on your mental health will help you and your partner mend your relationship’s fences. Things won’t be okay right away, so you have to be patient and take it slow.</p>\n<p>For medical queries, go to your doctor. They will be able to explain the causes and symptoms of your condition clearly and thoroughly and provide treatment options. The first step to cure ED entirely is to address the underlying cause. If it’s hypertension, your doctor will prescribe medication and lifestyle changes to lower your high blood pressure.</p>\n<h3><strong>Take Medications</strong></h3>\n<p>After consulting your doctor for help, they may prescribe medication to help you manage the underlying health condition causing ED and address the inability to achieve or sustain an erection. Note that certain medications may have side effects. If you experience any of them, go to your doctor for further consultation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Shift Your Lifestyle</strong></h3>\n<p>Lifestyle changes may be necessary to fight off erectile dysfunction. Men with ED should practice the following habits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quitting smoking</li>\n<li>Reducing or stopping alcohol consumption</li>\n<li>Quitting drug use</li>\n<li>Increased regular exercise</li>\n<li>Healthy weight maintenance</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Use Penis Pumps</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://theenhancedmale.com/collections/penis-pumps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Penis pumps</a> or vacuum pumps are viable ED treatment options. They help increase blood flow to the penis, keeping the erection maintained. These devices may look and sound intimidating, especially for people who’ve just known about their existence. Don’t worry, though. Penis pumps are generally safe to use as long as you follow instructions correctly and don’t have specific underlying conditions.</p>\n<p>These pumps come in <a href=\"https://theenhancedmale.com/products/bathmate-hercules-penis-enhancement-pump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">various forms</a> and have unique features. Before buying one, do your research about the ins and outs of penis pumps. This way, you’ll know what you’ll be getting yourself into. If you have a history of blood clots or are taking blood-thinning medication, consult your doctor before using a penis pump.</p>\n<p>Always ask your doctor’s professional input every time you want to try an alternative treatment for erectile dysfunction. Some treatments may have serious side effects, and you want to avoid that as much as possible.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Dealing with erectile dysfunctions can be tough on relationships. Thankfully, there are more than enough resources and information to deal with the condition. But before you get to treating ED, you have to take the first step of acknowledging and talking about it to your partner. Things will be a lot less stressful if you’re honest about what you’re going through from the beginning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Caitlin McNulty</strong></p>\n<p>Although general election years are always stressful in anticipation for our next president, the past couple elections have been especially emotionally charged due to the increased hostility among political parties and subsequent distain toward members of opposing groups. With politics being at the forefront of our daily lives, it is a common topic of conversation among romantic partners – which sometimes creates conflict when disagreement occurs. Here we’ll discuss how you can actively take steps to minimize political differences’ negative impacts and allow your relationship to continue to flourish by understanding how they can take a toll on your romantic relationship.</p>\n<p>When you and your partner disagree on political issues, you may feel strain and stress within your relationship. Political disagreement between romantic partners can generate doubts about your compatibility on core values and beliefs, making you feel less like a team and more like opponents. When you feel more emotionally distanced from your partner, you may feel less committed to the relationship, which could make you less affectionate and appreciative of your partner. However, it is extremely important to notice that these increases in stress are temporary and your relationship is not doomed to fail solely because you and your partner differ politically. It is also important to consider how much your differing political views weigh in your overall relationship satisfaction, which depends on how political you and your partner consider yourselves to be. If politics have not been a major factor in your decision to enter into a committed relationship with your partner thus far, you may be more willing to be in a relationship with someone of a different political affiliation than yourself without it causing relationship-threatening issues. However, if politics are a major component of your life and something you are not willing to agree to disagree on, it may be a more significant detriment on your overall relationship satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Because politics is currently taking over our country, it may be easy to conclude that this is the source of all your relationship problems. Research shows that you and your partner are less likely to argue over political issues or be significantly impacted by political stress if you have consistently invested time in maintaining a healthy relationship prior to election season. If you and your partner spend quality time together, lean on each other for support, actively communicate, do exciting things together, and have a healthy sex life, then differing political ideology should not outweigh all of those positive behaviors. Research shows that couples with differing political ideologies are no more likely to break up than couples with similar political ideologies. Therefore, you and your partner’s overall relationship satisfaction will lead to future relationship success or failure, not solely your differing political views.</p>\n<p>If you find political disagreement with your partner taking more of a toll on your relationship than you would like it to, you could benefit from changing your mindset and seeing your differing political views as an opportunity to expand your worldview and listen to a different perspective. As much as we would like to think we know exactly what is right, that may not necessarily be true. It could be both educational and healthy for your relationship to hear your partner’s opposing political view. Understanding that political issues are not as black-and-white as they seem to be in today’s world can make you more willing to actively listen and understand where your partner is coming from instead of dismissing their views as wrong and having conflict in your relationship. Having a mature conversation about your political views with your partner will positively maintain your relationship by streamlining communication and leading to mutual respect of opinions. It is okay – and even healthy – to realize that you and your partner, although complementary in many ways, are still two different people who grew up with two different life experiences and learned values. As long as you both respect each other’s opinions on political issues and make genuine effort in maintaining a healthy relationship overall, the current political climate should not shatter the entire relationship you have built to the ground.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Corinne Issa</strong></p>\n<p>With over 30 million Americans turning to online dating apps to find suitable partners each year—a number that continues to rise&#8211;it seems inevitable that, whether you want to just have fun or find “the one,” eventually you’ll venture into the cyber world to set up your own dating profile and review the profiles of prospective dates. So how should you go about presenting yourself in the best light? How can you interpret the information of potential partners? What are the largely unconscious factors that have induced you to swipe right or left? In the online dating world, it is important not only to address these questions, but also to fully understand your own responses when examining the profiles of potential partners: a thorough grasp of these elements will allow you to utilize some techniques that might make your experience a happier one.</p>\n<h2><strong>Choosing the Best Profile Picture</strong></h2>\n<p>First, you need to put some serious time and effort into your self-presentation, since it will become the primary strategy through which you can shape others’ view and impression of you. Photos that are more expansive, where the posture is open and the stance is wide, are more likely to invite a swipe to the right and increase the odds of making a successful romantic connection. An open stance conveys a sense of confidence, which is perceived as more attractive. Surveys show that potential daters rate smiling photos as more attractive than serious ones. In addition, the smile is an open invitation with its own message. A smiling person is less risky because the confidence he or she conveys indicates that person is friendly and happy. Since most relationships start with that first green light, the smile can produce a chain effect.</p>\n<p>Of course, you need to comment on that profile picture. When analyzing the attractiveness of texts (in the creation of a profile), it was found that more alluring written description went hand in hand with smiling photos: just as the smile conveyed confidence, so did the words. Of course, in writing for confidence, you should make sure you don’t overdo it; over-confidence actually indicates insecurity or self-absorption, two traits that are more likely to be dismissed with a swipe to the left.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Emoji as an Aid</strong></h2>\n<p>Even online, communication has to be at the “heart” of the dating experience. To maximize how you are perceived, disclose the greatest amount of information, and heighten the interest level in pursuing a relationship, you should consider using emojis as nonverbal cues. Emojis can succeed where simple text often fails in providing clearer intent and tone. Compared to a text chat, versions featuring more nonverbal cues through emojis produced more favorable perceptions of the potential partner and greater disclosure. In other words, a simple text exchange won’t completely cut it: you need emojis, like blowing a kiss, that send a clear signal. Emojis are expressive in showcasing nonverbal communication messages you would be sending if you were meeting a date in person.</p>\n<h2><strong>What Text Reveals</strong></h2>\n<p>An impression is formed on both sides not only through the picture, but also though the “decoding” of text in the profile or exchange. Studies show that people will infer personality traits (and therefore compatibility) by interpreting the language. Here’s where subtext can become a valuable tool both for the profile you present and the text exchange with the person you are checking out. According to Stephanie Tom Tong, professor of Communications at Wayne State University, your profile is crucial because it is the first and primary means of expressing oneself during the early stages of online dating. Your profile can therefore foreclose or create relationship opportunities. She urges the use of natural language to put the other at ease, since this linguistic information is the primary means of interpreting cues. As the sender and the observer, you have to examine your own profile for these subtle messages that might attract or repel potential partners, even as you look for the cues in those you seek to attract. Word length and choice, grammar, sentence length, and vocabulary are all useful tools in assessing personality. Be clear and use everyday vocabulary and be conscious and use correct grammar. Don’t be shy about including some humor; this trait was positively associated with openness to experience, agreeableness, and emotional stability. Words showcase your personality: use them to convey an attention to detail both for yourself and in interpreting the words of others.</p>\n<h2><strong>Take-home Message</strong></h2>\n<p>If you decide to dive into the online dating pool, keep in mind that you want to also attract the most promising partners and convey your own attractiveness to them. Since in-person non-verbal cues are missing from the cyber experience, make the most of the verbal and linguistic cues, including emoji’s, at your disposal. Create a compelling, open, and confident profile as a crucial means of making a first impression; attend to those subtle details that can say so much about your positive qualities. Look for the minute cues in the presentational messages of others to see if they also took care with the details. A possible partner’s well-written post indicates investment in the process and potentially in you. Likewise, a grammatically incorrect or poorly written post might indicate a lack of education or indifference to the process.</p>\n<p>Verbal and non-verbal components in online dating can tell an entire story about you and your dating prospects. But, with the level of anonymity involved, can you trust the process to be as revealing as we’ve outlined here? The answer to that question is a surprising “probably.” Notions that people frequently lie online is inaccurate. Now, if you opt to join the more than one-third of today’s dating couples who have formed online dating relationships, you can shape your profile and review the profiles of possible partners with the knowledge that you’ve optimized your chances for finding romance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Natalia Walcott</strong></p>\n<p>No matter how hard you try, there is no running away from stress. It can occur during any part of your day, whether it be while driving, working, running errands, or while with your partner, etc. Although you cannot always anticipate stress and prevent it from happening, you can control how you react to that stress. There is no reason to transfer your individual stress onto your partner and cause conflict when there was none to begin with. Relationships are not always easy and will present multiple challenges throughout their duration. It is important to recognize the signs that your relationship is being affected by multiple internal and external stressors. Here are a few signs to consider.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Both of You Are More Distant and Less Engaged With Each Other:</span></h2>\n<p>When you are stressed, you are unable to think clearly. You may lash out at your partner and be very dismissive. If you had a bad day at work and feel overwhelmed with stress, you are more likely to express feelings of irritability/ anger, withdrawal, and rejection towards your partner. At that point, you have allowed the stress from your job to spill over into your relationship. This type of negative behavior does not allow for proper communication as a couple and can lead to unnecessary arguments. The inadequate communications skills caused by your stress can lead to alienation from one another if it continues.</p>\n<p>If you notice this taking place, take a step back and analyze the situation. Figure out what the main stressor is and work with your partner to relieve the stress so that these negative conversations can become less frequent. The use of invisible support, like cooking your partner’s favorite meal before they come home from a stressful day at work, can help alleviate the stress without directly trying to find a solution to their problems. It is common to fall out of sync with your partner every once and awhile, but do not allow it to hurt your relationship.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">There Is A Decline in the Amount of Sex:</span></h2>\n<p>When you are stressed, your mind is preoccupied with dealing with the situation that caused the stress. In dealing with it, it takes time away from your day that you could have spent with your significant other. You are burnt out and exhausted, so it is not unreasonable to assume that you would want some time to yourself. It is also reasonable to assume that having sex with your partner is the last thing on your mind. However, this needs to be communicated to your partner because they cannot read your mind. Make sure your partner knows why you are not in the mood to have sex with them. Tell them that you have had an exhausting day/week and need some time to recharge &#8211; mentally and physically. Reassure them that the decline in intimacy on your part is not a reflection of your lack of love or attraction to them. If they know what is going on, they can understand the situation and provide help in ways that you find beneficial. Even if you are not in the mood for sex, maybe having a movie night cuddled up on the couch can keep the romance alive and allow for some decompressing on your part.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Taking the Stress Out on Each Other:</span></h2>\n<p>Bad days are inevitable. However, taking your anger out on your partner is not the solution. This can cause you to take out your personal stress to your partner, causing both of you to be in a bad mood. This bad mood can lead to nagging and picking fights over the smallest things. It can also cause you to be over-critical of your partner, leading to their withdrawal. Nobody wants to have everything they do scrutinized and judged, when in the grand scheme of things, they are not doing anything wrong. When you are stressed, our brains fixate on negative thoughts and events. You need to actively fight against transferring your anger and frustration onto your partner. Remember that they are your biggest fan and want to see you happy. Allowing your negative behavior that’s caused by your stress to come between you and your partner is unacceptable. Have a conversation about the situation and work together to remove the tension from your relationship.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Marital Satisfaction is Going Down:</span></h2>\n<p>No one likes to constantly be around stress and conflict. Life is too short to be sweating over the small stuff and stuck in a situation where you are constantly miserable. When stress is continuously introduced into your relationship, it can become mentally draining and negatively affect how satisfied and committed you feel within your partner. If you and your partner are living together, you will experience more stressors due to your financial and living situation being dependent on one another. When faced with stress, it can have a negative impact on your relationship satisfaction. Research shows that wives are less satisfied in their relationship when met with stress compared to their husbands. This gives wives the perception that their relationship is falling apart and that they have problems in multiple areas. It also shows that the more stress you have, the more you blame your partner, and the greater the decline of your relationship satisfaction. This is where good communication comes into play. Although it might be a difficult conversation to have, it is necessary to talk to your partner about your current feelings with your relationships. Once it is addressed, mitigating steps need to be taken to repair the relationship satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Everyone is human at the end of the day and is bound to be affected by stressors. It is how you treat our partners and the amount of communication occurring while stressed that plays a big role in relationship satisfaction. If your partner verbally lashes out at you when they are having a bad day, try to take a step back and realize that their anger is misplaced. Communicate your feelings about that negative behavior with your partner so that it doesn&#8217;t occur in the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Natalia Walcott</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s be frank, long distance relationships suck. No one wants to be away from their spouse or significant other. Being away from them for prolonged periods of time is even harder. You will very seldom find someone who says “Yeah, me and my partner are in a long distance relationship, and it is the best thing that has ever happened to us. I love being hundreds of miles away from them and Facetiming on the phone.” We naturally want to be around those that we care about. Personally coping with that separation can be difficult. In addition to that, you have to help your significant other cope with the distance as well. Many say distance makes the heart grow fonder, but you can&#8217;t just rely on that. Actively taking a role in maintaining your relationship is necessary to its survival. Try some of these suggestions to help preserve your long distance relationship.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. Stay Positive</strong></h2>\n<p>Take control of your attitude about the distance. You cannot change the circumstances. However, bringing positivity into an already difficult situation can help you and your partner cope with the situation. Tell your partner how much you love and appreciate them. Surrounding your relationship with this positive energy will help your relationship satisfaction increase.</p>\n<p>Think of why you two got together in the first place and decided to continue the relationship, despite the distance. Before you and your partner began the long distance relationship, a conversation must have occurred. It probably consisted of where both of you saw the relationship going and what the future held. This already shows the seriousness of your relationship and the fact that both of you saw something worth holding on to. Research shows that long distance couples are more committed to their partners than geographically close partners. Take this as a positive sign that the odds are in your favor.</p>\n<p>Find comfort in the little things. Remember that this distance will not last forever. You have someone who loves you and wants to be with you despite the obstacles. On top of that, you have the ability to focus on yourself and become a better version of you that your partner has not experienced yet.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Practice Necessary Communication</strong></h2>\n<p>Talk to your partner about the amount and type of communication you expect. Having those conversations can help prevent problems in the future. Communicating everyday does not mean your relationship is any better than one where you communicate three days out of the week. Every relationship is different and presents unique needs and expectations.</p>\n<p>Do not believe that you have to compensate for the lack of physical interaction by constantly texting your partner. This can get mentally draining and might annoy your significant other. Communication should arise organically; you should not feel like you are obligated to communicate with your partner.</p>\n<p>Be sure to congratulate your partner when they relay positive news to you. Acknowledge and capitalize on their achievements, since you aren&#8217;t able to physically be there to celebrate with them. The acknowledgement of those positive events can allow your partner to see that you are just as happy and invested into seeing them succeed as they are. It also gives both of you a positive event in the relationship to celebrate.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. FaceTime Each Other</strong></h2>\n<p>We are very lucky to have the ability to see each other while not being anywhere near each other. Video chats have given us a different way of communication. Since you are unable to physically see your partner, the next best thing is FaceTiming (or Zooming, etc.) them. Research shows that seeing your partner can deepen the sense of connectedness in that moment and throughout the relationship. Looking into each other&#8217;s eyes and seeing your partner’s face as they smile and talk can make you feel closer to them. Recognize that this type of communication will be less frequent than texting and most likely require some planning ahead of time. Alternating between texting, calling, and video chatting can be beneficial to your relationship. Remember that you are not obligated to constantly communicate with your partner.</p>\n<h2><strong>4. Don’t Idealize or Villainize Your Partner</strong></h2>\n<p>When we’re happy in our relationships, we tend to think of our partners as better than they actually are. Despite the separation between you two, the idealization of your partner can be beneficial to keeping the relationship together. However, it also makes reuniting with your partner more difficult and possibly disappointing. Remember that people change, and it is not necessarily a bad thing. Both of you have been apart from each other for some time, and are bound to change. Whether it be in regards to appearance or personality, do not expect the perfect image of your partner to walk through your door.</p>\n<p>Likewise, don’t be too hard on your partner. Since you two are living apart and do not know each other&#8217;s daily lives, it can be easy to make assumptions about what they are doing and who they are hanging out with. Confronting your partner about these assumptions could come off as jealous or possessive and potentially pose a threat to the relationship. You both are a part of each other&#8217;s lives, but at the same time, you have lives outside of the relationship. Your partner cannot devote all of their time to you. They might be busy and can&#8217;t return a call or text. Don’t assume that they have lost interest in the relationship; communicate what you are feeling and go into it with a positive attitude.</p>\n<h2><strong>5. Make Time Out of Your Schedules to Visit Each Other</strong></h2>\n<p>Shared activities are important in maintaining a relationship. It allows for self-expansion and the introduction of novelty into the relationship. Being in a long distance relationship makes it harder for those shared activities to occur.</p>\n<p>It is important to have something to look forward to in the relationship. The long distance between you and your partner should not be or feel permanent. Take time out of your schedules to visit each other. This reunion should be fun and introduce you to a part of your partner’s world that you have been missing out on.</p>\n<p>Don’t spend all of your time hanging out at their place. Make the most out your trip. Go out and become integrated into their social networks. Getting to know your partner’s friends and enjoying their favorite activities with them will get you more acquainted with their life. It also allows you to participate in future conversations with your partner when you are apart This is because you have created new memories together and have familiarity with important people in their life.</p>\n<p>Long distance relationships might be hard, but with the right person, they can also be rewarding. Making the decision to commit to a long distance relationship already shows that you both believe that the love between you two could conquer the distance. Be sure to put time into the relationship and exercise effective communication. Remember, it takes two to maintain a relationship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Caitlin McNulty</strong></p>\n<p>As much as I would like to sugarcoat it, the truth is that breakups are hard. Add a global pandemic and months of quarantine into the mix, and you are in for a real treat. To those of you who are going through a breakup or divorce in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, know that you are not alone. China has seen a significant rise in divorce filings since their quarantine lifted slightly in March, which unfortunately may be paralleled in the United States as the pandemic continues and stay-at-home restrictions prolong. Although divorces and breakups in general are occurring for a multitude of reasons, the pandemic has increased financial troubles, lack of control, too much time with your partner if living together, too little time with your partner if long-distance, and, frankly, too much time to reflect on your relationship and whether or not you are satisfied with your partner – all of which can be detrimental to a healthy or already-suffering relationship.</p>\n<p>As social distancing has become part of our “new normal,” it is especially difficult to experience a breakup in today’s world with the inability to travel, spend quality time with friends and family, and stay occupied in public as a means of speeding up the breakup recovery process. If you are having a difficult time processing how to move on from a relationship while the world is almost at a complete stand-still, try engaging in the suggestions below to help get you back on track and thriving by the time the pandemic is over.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. Restart or Find New Hobbies</strong></h2>\n<p>Although it may have been months or even years since you have been single, remember the time before your relationship &#8211; when <em>you</em> were your top priority. What activities did you enjoy doing? How did you de-stress? It may feel strange to have to relearn what you once enjoyed doing, but this is actually a very common challenge for newly single people. Depending on the length of your relationship, you may have invested in and relied on your partner in your everyday routine for a long time, which makes the recovery process especially difficult. Although it may seem overwhelming at first, slowly reintegrate yourself into activities that tap into your strengths and make you feel your best. Although options are limited while staying at home, there are still a myriad of things to do to make yourself happy. Remember that book you have always wanted to read? Order it online. How about that show you heard everyone talking about but never had time to watch? Play the pilot episode. Do you want to master your apple pie recipe? Head to the grocery store and get baking. Do whatever will make you happy in the long-run.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Feel <em>all</em> the Emotions</strong></h2>\n<p>Although you may wish you could just erase the horrible feelings that are associated with a breakup, it is important to work through what you are feeling in order to move forward. If you are having a bad day filled with self-doubt and worries about the future, embrace that feeling and cry it out instead of attempting to suppress those negative emotions. Psychologists have found that attempts to suppress any negative thoughts and emotions actually cause you to obsess over the exact thought that you are attempting to ignore – a psychological phenomenon called the paradoxical effect of thought suppression. In turn, this pattern prolongs your negative emotional state instead of allowing you to feel the negative emotions when they arise and move on quicker. Especially in quarantine, we have lots of time to ourselves to think about what went wrong in our relationship, what qualities we did not like in our partners that we will aim to avoid moving forward, and what qualities we did not like in ourselves that may have contributed to the breakup. Whatever the case, feel when you are sad, feel when you are happy, feel when you are grateful, and feel when you are angry. Do not suppress your feelings because you think that will make you stronger. It actually makes you stronger to tap into your emotions and fully understand how your relationship has impacted you and your emotional well-being. Be mindful that if you have previously been diagnosed with depression or if your negative emotions become too overwhelming for you to handle on your own that it is strongly encouraged seek help from a professional.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. Get Creative with Social Support</strong></h2>\n<p>Although there has been mixed evidence about the role of social support in speeding up the breakup recovery process, it is especially beneficial to reach out to your loved ones, especially if quarantining alone, in this time of extreme uncertainty and increased loneliness. The myriad of social networking apps and websites can help you get out of your antisocial slump while social gatherings are essentially non-existent due to nationwide capacity limits, closed bars and restaurants, cancelled events, and stay-at-home restrictions. Schedule a Zoom happy hour with your high school or college friends, host a Netflix party and watch your favorite movie with your loved ones, have a socially distanced hangout in your backyard, or even keep it simple with a quick text, phone call, or FaceTime to a friend. Although it is preferable to see someone face-to-face, it is simply not realistic during COVID-19, and you will be shocked at how good it feels to just talk to someone virtually and gain some sort of social interaction during quarantine.</p>\n<h2><strong>4. Soak Up Some Vitamin D</strong></h2>\n<p>Vitamin D from the sun has been proven to buffer humans from a variety of mental health conditions, but most notably from depression. While many Westerners have deficient levels of Vitamin D regularly, the rate is likely rising due to being cooped up inside while following COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Increased negative emotions due to the breakup and decreased exposure to Vitamin D is a bad combination that could lead you to develop depression or other mood disorders. Therefore, to minimize your chances of sinking into a psychological slump, head outside every day to obtain Vitamin D and recharge your battery. The sun is always a good choice (with SPF, of course!), and getting outside is one of the only safe activities we can participate in these days. If you live near the coast, hop in your car and take a day trip to the beach. If you live near the mountains, research open trails and go for a hike. Even without exquisite landscapes, taking daily walks around your neighborhood will allow you to leave your house, soak up the sun, and clear your mind. You can even lie by the pool if that is an option for you at home. The possibilities are endless with outdoor activities, so soak up some Vitamin D to help you get back on your feet and decrease your chances of accumulating a negative mental health outcome due to the negative combination of the breakup and quarantine.</p>\n<h2><strong>5. Step into the World of Online Dating</strong></h2>\n<p>Although you may not want to take this step for weeks or months post-breakup, the world of online dating is extremely beneficial in the age of COVID-19. Since we are limited in exposure to potential partners in the “traditional” setting of bars, gyms, and the like, take advantage of the plethora of online dating platforms. There are so many focus areas in online dating apps and sites (including by interests, geographical location, and other background factors) if you are looking for someone who matches some specific aspect of your personality. Or, you can go rogue and use the more mainstream, lackadaisical, trending apps. Although there are skeptics of online dating as a successful way to truly connect with a partner, recent research has shown that couples who met online were less likely to divorce or separate and were more likely to report higher marital satisfaction compared to couples who met “traditionally,” or offline. This finding should make you hopeful that although you cannot go out and meet anyone in the public sphere, you may actually have more luck finding a long-term partner online. Keep in mind that everyone recovers from a breakup at their own pace and has a different timeline of when they feel ready to get back out there, so take your time, feel what you need to feel, and know that online dating is just a click away when you feel ready to take that step.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Sophie Schwartz</strong></p>\n<p>Navigating relationships is hard. There will always be new obstacles to overcome, new conflicts to resolve, or new feelings to understand. We all remember the excitement and intensity that comes with being in a new relationship, and we strive to keep those feelings alive for as long as possible. But what happens when the honeymoon phase ends? It is well established that relationship satisfaction – how happy you are in your relationship – tends to decline over the course of relationships. This fact can be really disheartening, especially for individuals who are trying desperately to maintain happiness, closeness, and intimacy with their partners but don’t know why the spark has gone out and don’t know how to get it back. Research has shown that there are many behaviors and activities that couples can use to help maintain intimacy and happiness in their relationships. Relationship Maintenance Behaviors (RMBs) are these activities. They are intended to enhance the relationship and/or keep the relationship moving forward. Below are five relationship maintenance behaviors that any couple can use to help strengthen their relationship, reignite the spark that has been lost, and maintain happiness and intimacy long-term.</p>\n<h2><strong>#1: Spend Quality Time Together</strong></h2>\n<p>It goes without saying that spending time together promotes closeness. In romantic relationships both shared relationship activities and joint leisure activities, have been shown to improve relationship functioning and happiness in all stages and types of relationships – dating, cohabiting, long-distance, marriage, and so on. Any activity that partners can do <em>together</em> constitutes relationship activities: going to see a movie, taking art or cooking classes, going for a hike, or taking a trip.</p>\n<p>Evidence from various studies tells us that exciting and novel activities – rather than pleasant, relaxing, or routine activities – are more likely to improve relationship quality and facilitate closeness between partners. Importantly, the best and most fulfilling activities, in terms of relationship satisfaction and overall happiness, are those which <em>both</em> partners enjoy and are motivated to participate in. Any activity can be beneficial to any couple, but only if both partners are excited to do it. The <em>quality</em> of the time you spend together – more than the amount of time and the type of activity – will be what determines whether the shared activity is beneficial for your relationship or not.</p>\n<h2><strong>#2: Maintain Relationship Rituals</strong></h2>\n<p>Relationship rituals are exchanges between partners that are planned, occur regularly, and have symbolic meaning. There is a distinct difference between a ritual and a routine in that routines are things that simply need to be done like folding the laundry or grocery shopping. Grocery shopping <em>can</em> be a ritual, but only if the couple places significant meaning on that activity.</p>\n<p>Research shows that having and maintaining relationship rituals can increase levels of commitment in a relationship. Essentially, showing commitment to the ritual indicates to your partner that you are committed to them. Couples who continually engage in their chosen ritual(s) tend to show higher levels of relationship satisfaction and experience more positive emotions all around. One common relationship ritual is weekly or regular date nights, but any kind of activity can serve the purpose of a ritual as long as both you and your partner believe the act to be meaningful and symbolically powerful in the context of your relationship together.</p>\n<h2><strong>#3: Mitigate Potential Threats</strong></h2>\n<p>Sometimes individuals find themselves being attracted to people other than their partner. Alternative others, potential others, and potential alternatives all refer to the individuals that could potentially pose a threat to your relationship – people that represent alternatives to your current relationship. In a world full of potential alternatives, how do you maintain commitment and lower the risk of infidelity?</p>\n<p>One option is to derogate, or downplay the attractiveness of, potential alternatives. This cognitive technique has been shown to help individuals who are highly motivated to stay committed to their partners. The downside is that one cannot be forced to ignore potential alternatives. Forcing your partner to ignore potential others may elicit the opposite of the intended effect and push your partner further towards the forbidden fruit.</p>\n<p>Another option is to avoid suggestive or risky situations or people. A few simple examples of this could be getting separate rooms when traveling with a co-worker, not eating lunch with the same acquaintance every day, or limiting your interaction with potential others online. The point of avoidance is to set boundaries, recognize when your relationship with a potential alternative is posing a threat to your current relationship, and remove yourself from situations that may invoke intimate feelings with alternative others. It will benefit you and your relationship to save your emotional energy and cognitive resources for your partner or for friends who are clearly not potential romantic partners.</p>\n<h2><strong>#4: Forgive</strong></h2>\n<p>Allowing yourself to forgive someone who has hurt you is not an easy task. Whether it be lesser offenses or full-blown cheating, forgiveness takes a lot of patience, time, and understanding. Forgiveness can be characterized by a desire to forgo condemnation or revenge even when these feelings seem justified. Despite the difficulties of forgiving a partner who has broken your trust or hurt you in some other way, forgiveness has been shown to facilitate many positive relationship outcomes such as increased commitment, decreased likelihood of break-ups, increased constructive communication, and increased relationship satisfaction. Some even suggest that forgiveness is foundational to the healing process.</p>\n<p>Forgiveness allows for healing in the victim of the offense <em>and</em> encourages self-reflection and accountability in the offender. In many cases, forgiveness can be a beacon of hope for couples teetering on the edge of collapse after trust has been broken or pain has been caused; however, there are circumstances that do not warrant forgiveness. When the offense is repeated or particularly extreme, forgiving the offender may only make things worse. The trick is to know what your personal limits are – when is forgiveness appropriate, and when have your partner’s actions surpassed what you can tolerate?</p>\n<h2><strong>#5: Assess and Re-Assess the Relationship</strong></h2>\n<p>“So… what are we?” Many people have experienced first-hand what it is like to ask or be asked this question by a significant other. Typically, we think of these ‘state of the relationship’ conversations as occurring at the start of a new relationship to define “what we are to each other.” Conversations like these provide couples with clarification on individual expectations going into a new relationship, and that is great. Once the state of the relationship is declared, however, many couples fail to revisit these conversations until the time comes to either take the next step or take a step back.</p>\n<p>The ‘state of the relationship’ conversation, is not only a mechanism to define the relationship at the beginning but also to express partners’ wants, needs, commitment levels, and goals <em>throughout</em> the relationship. While these conversations may seem awkward, taboo, scary, or conflict provoking, relationship talk has been widely proven to increase relationship satisfaction and protect against break-ups. Regularly talking about and building your relationship together acts a protective factor against possible infidelity, and can facilitate intimacy through the disclosure of sensitive topics. By regularly re-evaluating and keeping up with each other’s wants, needs, commitment levels, and desires, couples can promote intimacy and strengthen the relationship as a whole.</p>\n<h2><strong>Be Flexible</strong></h2>\n<p>Like everything else in life relationships <em>will change</em>, and couples may have to change along with them; but change doesn’t have to be negative. Refusing to acknowledge that your relationship needs some attention will only make things worse. Recognize that change is inevitable <em>and</em> that you have the power to navigate the waters of change with positivity and resilience.</p>\n<p>Spending quality time together, maintaining relationship rituals, mitigating potential threats, forgiving, and regularly re-assessing your relationship are five things that any couple can do to help strengthen and reinforce their relationship, but this list is far from exhaustive. There are tons of other ways to strengthen and protect relationships: practicing gratitude, having a supportive social network, or even having sex! Spend the time looking for the relationship maintenance behaviors that work best for your relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Caitlin McNulty</strong></p>\n<p>Television and movies play a significant role in our daily lives, which should come as no surprise considering the average American household watches 7 hours and 50 minutes of television per day. Moreover, popular date night activities include going to the movies or staying in to binge-watch the latest hit television show. However, have you ever stopped to think about whether the movies and television shows you watch impact how you act and what you expect from your relationship? Research shows that constant exposure to media’s depictions of romantic relationships may form or reinforce your own behaviors and interactions. This alternate reality can be either beneficial or detrimental to your relationship, depending on what you watch, how long you watch it, and how realistic you believe it to be.</p>\n<h2><strong>Romantic Programming</strong></h2>\n<p>Romantic movies and television series can have different effects on your relationship depending on how you perceive what you are viewing. On one hand, romantic programming can be a good influence on your relationship through its reinforcement of optimistic relationship outcomes. Research shows that television comedies, television dramas, and romantic movies all positively affect one’s relationship through the consistent themes of love conquering all and having soulmates. Can you think of one romantic comedy where the main characters don’t end up together? Even in La La Land, when they don’t actually end up together, the writers still included an alternative ending so they could show what happens if they did end up together! By consistently portraying happy endings even after conflict, movies and television shows reinforce the idea that no matter what happens between a couple, true love overcomes everything. With thousands of easy-to-follow plots reinforcing this exact ideal, we are programmed to believe that this is true and can happen in our own relationships as well.</p>\n<p>However, romantic programming can also be a bad influence on your relationship if there is a divide between what television and movies portray as normal relationship behaviors and what you are actually experiencing. Research shows that more time spent watching relationship programming is associated with lower relationship satisfaction. Romantic programming – whether it be a rom-com, drama, or soap opera – tends to foster unrealistic standards and expectations of partners by their portrayal of the “ideal” partner. When one partner messes up in a romantic movie or television show, he or she tends to know exactly what to do to make it all better – whether it be a grand gesture or the perfect apology. Let’s face it: no significant other in real life knows exactly what to say and do to make it up to the other partner after every conflict. Resolution between partners in a real relationship requires communication, not mindreading like soap operas and dramas often depict.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Reality Dating Shows</strong></h2>\n<p>Dating shows have become one of the most popular subcategories of reality television over the past few decades. While the Bachelor was basically one-of-a-kind in the early 2000s, there are now dozens of different reality dating shows available for streaming today, with seven new variations premiering in 2020 alone. One theme that is constantly reinforced on reality dating shows is the idea that dating is a game. This idea normalizes the fact that multiple people should be competing for your love, instead of focusing your attention on cultivating one relationship with a potential partner. This perspective may make men and women more hesitant to settle down and form serious bonds with one another.</p>\n<p>Reality dating shows also constantly reinforce gender stereotypes: that men are sex-driven and women are sex objects. One study found that these roles were reinforced once every 4 minutes for an hour in a sample of different reality dating shows. This constant reinforcement of sexual gender roles can lead to unrealistic expectations about sex within a relationship and blur the boundaries that women have when it comes to sex, which could increase conflict in a relationship.</p>\n<p>How realistic one perceives reality dating shows significantly affects how one perceives their own relationships. If you watch the Bachelor purely for comedic relief or to scout out your next vacation destination, then these stereotypes may not carry over into your relationship. However, if you view it as a guide to finding true love and planning the perfect date, these stereotypes may carry significant weight in how you act in your relationship.</p>\n<h2><strong>Violent Media</strong></h2>\n<p>Excessive exposure to violent programming can negatively affect your relationship. Violence is portrayed in television and movies as either physical aggression, such as punching and hitting, or emotional aggression, such as manipulation and yelling. Researchers have found that repeated exposure to physical aggression on television is associated with men’s increased physical aggression in romantic relationships. Films and television shows that depict physical violence between romantic partners tend to portray the male as the perpetrator and the female as the victim, which increases the tendency of men to mirror physical violence in their own relationships. On the other hand, repeated exposure to verbal or emotional aggression on television is associated with increased verbal or emotional aggression for both males and females. Verbal aggression is instigated by both sexes in the media, which reinforces its normalcy in relationships among both partners. While it is important for different media sources to shed light on the dangers of physical violence, a detrimental side effect is that it may also normalize aggression and constant conflict among couples.</p>\n<h2><strong>Take Home Message</strong></h2>\n<p>What you consume daily gets ingrained into your brain and either consciously or subconsciously manifests itself in your behaviors. Although television and movies can have positive impacts on your relationship, they can also carry some negative impacts as well. To protect your relationship from the negative effects of TV and movies, make sure to realize that most movies and television shows – even reality shows – are scripted and therefore not real life. By drawing the line between fictional relationships and real relationships, you can still enjoy your favorite movies while maintaining realistic expectations towards your partner and your relationship as a whole.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Corinne Issa</strong></p>\n<p>They call it the seven-year-itch for a reason: the fact is, falling in love is really not that hard. Staying in love? That’s another matter altogether. Those early butterflies can make you feel as if you’re the luckiest person on the planet. But as time passes, we get to know our partners’ habits and reactions. They become…predictable. And predictable sometimes means boring. Of course, that doesn’t mean that every love affair is doomed, but the spark does fade from many relationships. We’ve all seen it: people drift apart. One challenge can be that the quirks you find so endearing when the relationship is new can become irritating or even maddening over time. That predictability factor might be the culprit: when love is new, everything becomes more vivid and exciting. Then, that vibrancy seems to fade. Enter the antidote: the answer to the damage done by the erosion of time. If you want to feel the freshness of new love for a longer period of time—possibly even forever—make date night part of the spice that keeps things exciting.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Date Night Maintains the Relationship Spark</strong></span></h2>\n<p>I know&#8211; you’re suspicious. You&#8217;ve heard about restoring romance or intimacy by getting off the daily treadmill of your life and recapturing the ambiance of earlier days. But who has the time? Our jobs put us on different schedules, and wouldn’t it take more energy to link up our schedules? Besides, isn’t it normal to have the first flush of love fade a bit? I hear you. But the time to attend to the relationship is not when you feel the fade, but while love is still in bloom. Date night can relieve, not cause, more stress—and it just might bring a lifetime of happiness.</p>\n<p>Studies indicate that shared activities help sustain relationships; however, positive, stress-free activities and relationship quality &#8211; both in the moment and for the future &#8211; require both of you to want the activity and the result it might bring. Studies also indicate the quality of the connection should be a priority before there’s a threat to it. Most individuals who enjoyed their date night activities reported a positive impact on their relationship even after the event; they felt they had learned more about their partner and could implement higher levels of relationship skills.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Date Night Goes the Extra Mile</strong></span></h2>\n<p>Everyday maintenance is valuable, but date night can add that something extra. It presents opportunities to openly discuss thoughts and feelings, maintain a cheerful and affectionate demeanor, and gives the partner assurances associated with commitment and satisfaction; it also predicts whether the relationship will last over an 8-week period. Research shows that date nights have positive effects including a dedication to commitment, concern for the partner, more time to understand the significant other, shared fun time, and greater communication. If both members of a couple are willing to demonstrate these qualities, they are definitely long-term-relationship material.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Date Ideas</strong></span></h2>\n<p>So, what kind of activities work best in keeping a relationship healthy and thriving? Studies show that activities that are novel, exciting, and arousing will boost closeness more than those that are routine. According to one source, activities that are “adventurous, passionate, sexual, playful, romantic, spontaneous…and involving a high level of alertness and involvement” are those that best reinforce closeness and commitment. One study showed that partners who shared skydiving reported higher levels of relationship satisfaction than those who did not. I suppose if you’re willing to jump out of a plane for your partner, you’re invested in the relationship! Yet, closeness was reportedly highest when activities involved a balance of safety and risk: no one wants to explain to the ER doc that they were engaging in risky behavior to keep their relationship healthy. The getaway—a holiday or day at the beach—is at the top of the chart in fostering closeness and intimacy. Dining out, or even planning alone time where the couple cook together, shopping, gardening, or setting aside designated time for intimacy are all activities that work well. Knowing your partner’s preferences for any of these activities might provide the extra spark that keeps the flames burning. As with any activity and any successful relationship, communication and honesty are essential; accommodating the partner was a crucial aspect of both parties&#8217; positive relationship evaluation. Finally, pick activities that do not produce anxiety; studies show stress-free events generated more closeness and were associated with higher relationship quality. To keep it stress-free, show you’re invested! Don’t take on an activity you don’t like, simply because you want to make date night work. That shared mutually-attractive activity is out there: go find it.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The Value of Quality Time</strong></span></h2>\n<p>Yet, more important than the activity itself is the commitment from both parties to invest in spending time together. Studies show that positive activity outcomes depend less on what the couples do and more on how they feel about doing them together. Activities chosen for their ability to boost closeness work better than activities that are selected for the “fun-factor.” Also, when one half of the couple perceives the partner is only half-heartedly committed to the activity, lower closeness is reported. According to one study, couples who didn’t make it to the three-month mark of the study involved men who were not eager to participate in shared activities with their partners.</p>\n<p>Couples who build date nights into their relationships experience better communication, greater affection and gratitude for the other, and a desire to spend more time together. Date night provides a welcome entertainment so couples can return to focusing on important issues without distractions. The date night experience indicates that the partners are taking the relationship seriously and willing to invest in it. Both contribute to alleviating stress for the other during enjoyable events. One of the additional major perks? Date night leads to more shared time, which in turn, creates higher levels of sexual satisfaction.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Take Home Message</strong></span></h2>\n<p>If you have a good thing going and want your relationship to last, don’t wait for signs of trouble. Spice up your life now and reap the long-term benefits. Perhaps tonight, while sitting on the sofa, put a mischievous gleam in your eye, tilt your head to the side, and put it out there: “Hey honey, how about a date tonight?”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Lilly Johnsen</strong></p>\n<p>If you’ve discovered your partner cheated on you, you may be asking yourself what to do now. Infidelity is one of the most difficult and distressing issues that couples might face. After the discovery of an affair, you most likely will experience feelings such as jealousy, shame, rage, depression, fear, and loneliness. The biggest question after a couple faces infidelity is what they will do next. Will they break up or try to work through it? Couples with higher levels of commitment and satisfaction often try to work through the situation because they have invested a lot of time and effort into the relationship. Although very difficult, committed partnerships can survive the trauma of infidelity and even experience personal growth from the situation. If you find yourself in this situation, there are ways to try to repair the relationship and get past the feelings of anger and resentment. When deciding to work through the aftermath of an affair, forgiveness is the key part of healing.</p>\n<h2><strong>Decision-Based Forgiveness and Emotional-Based Forgiveness</strong></h2>\n<p>Forgiveness is crucial to helping partners with the emotional whirlwind that comes with cheating, and it can be the pathway to mending the relationship and rebuilding trust. There are two types of forgiveness you have to undergo in order to move forward with the relationship: decision-based forgiveness and emotional-based forgiveness. Decision-based forgiveness is the cognitive decision to let go of judgement and hostility. Decision-based forgiveness focuses on the actual commitment to forgive, and you can make this choice while still experiencing hurt. Decisional forgiveness comes first and can lead to emotional forgiveness. It is making the commitment to forgive, which is the beginning of an inner process of healing. Emotional forgiveness, on the other hand, is about reducing negative emotions, such as anger, resentment, and bitterness towards your partner. Emotional forgiveness is critical to gaining peace and moving on with the relationship. Forgiveness can be very difficult for someone who was cheated on, but if you want to rebuild the relationship, you must start here.</p>\n<h2><strong>Steps to Forgiveness</strong></h2>\n<p>The three main parts of forgiveness are dealing with the impact, searching for meaning, and recovery or moving forward. It may be hard for you to know where to start. These steps help outline a conversation that you and your partner should have to work towards decisional and eventually emotional forgiveness.</p>\n<h3><strong>Dealing with the Impact</strong></h3>\n<h4><em>Step 1 &#8211; Deciding if you want to forgive.</em></h4>\n<p>Deciding that you want to forgive is the first step in working through the situation. This does not mean you forgive what has happened, only that you are willing to move forwards and work towards actual forgiveness. It is possible, and very likely, that you still have emotional pain but want to continue the relationship. The first step is acknowledging you want to forgive your partner and move through the next steps.</p>\n<h4><em>Step 2 &#8211; Cheater should speak about their offense.</em></h4>\n<p>The partner involved in the affair should explain what happened, without leaving out other secrets that may be uncovered later. If all the information is out on the table, it allows you both to rebuild the relationship on honest and direct communication. Encourage them to be open during this time. Even though it might hurt, it will be best in the long run.</p>\n<h4><em>Step 3 &#8211; Offender explains their actions.</em></h4>\n<p>If your partner cheated on you, they must explain what led them to it, such as other relationship problems. Your partner should not use these explanations as an excuse, but to help you understand why it happened – and reduce the chance that it will happen again.</p>\n<h3><strong>Searching for Meaning</strong></h3>\n<h4><em>Step 4 &#8211; Give your emotional reactions.</em></h4>\n<p>After being cheated on, you will feel emotions such as anger, betrayal, and hurt. Processing emotions that were created by infidelity is critical to the process of recovering from it. The first step in processing emotions is to work through them on your own, which will allow you to explore how you truly feel and help in the recovery process. You may want to try writing down what you want to say to your partner. This will help you organize your thoughts and emotions and have a more productive conversation. In order to process these emotions, you must share them with your partner as well. Try not to be too emotionally reactive during this point in the conversation. Individuals who are less emotionally reactive and more able to communicate their feelings clearly are more likely to move forward with the forgiveness process.</p>\n<h4><em>Step 5 – Empathizing with your pain.</em></h4>\n<p>Ideally, your partner should provide empathy for the hurt they have caused you. When two people are struggling to work through something, it can be difficult for them to see the other’s point of view. Therefore, it is important to give your emotional reactions, so they can get a better understanding of the pain you’re going through. If your partner shows remorse and empathy for you and your feelings, you will be more likely to forgive them. Empathy can be an indirect pathway to both decisional and emotional forgiveness. Although you can’t control how your partner reacts, you can ask them to respond to your feelings and apologize for their behavior.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Recovery or Moving Forward</strong></h3>\n<h4><em>Step 6 &#8211; Develop a plan to stop or prevent future behavior.</em></h4>\n<p>An organized plan can help reduce your anxieties. Your partner should completely cut off from the third partner. This can help give you a sense of peace and security. It would be unwise (and unhealthy) to continue contact with that person, even if it is a friend. You may also want permission to check up on your partner when they are not around after they have cheated, due to the lack of trust. However, be cautious about frequently checking up. Constantly worrying about where your partner is may become obsessive and overbearing. If you want to check up on your partner, you should establish a plan with them. For example, plan where and when you call each other before bed or, if you live together, on business trips.</p>\n<h4><em>Step 7 &#8211; Let your partner forgive themselves.</em></h4>\n<p>Self-forgiveness is an important step in the whole forgiveness process for the involved party. When someone cheats on their loved one, they often face deep regrets and shame for their behaviors. They can deal with the negative emotions and views they have about themselves by accepting responsibility for their actions, expressing remorse, reducing self-shame, and recommitting to their values. This will lead to a renewal of self-respect, self-compassion, and self-acceptance. Let your partner go through the process of forgiving themselves.</p>\n<h4><em>Step 8 &#8211; A formal request for forgiveness.</em></h4>\n<p>After going through all of these steps, your partner should make a formal request for forgiveness. Human touch can be powerful during this time because it promotes connectedness. Take the hand of your partner or hug them when having this conversation. During this time, you and your partner should discuss how you want to move forward. If you decide to forgive, you must not use the offense as a weapon in future fights.</p>\n<p>It is not easy getting over infidelity, but the place to start is forgiveness. If you begin with the decision to forgive and let go of hostility, you can eventually reach a place of emotional forgiveness. Forgiveness is a powerful thing. A decision to forgive can help you deal with the feelings of stress, revenge, and hatred your partner has caused you. Being able to move on from the infidelity can lead to emotional relief and clarity – as well as higher relationship and life satisfaction. Forgiveness creates an increased understanding of each other. It promotes a feeling of a greater sense of closeness, intimacy, and freedom to be oneself. Couples who have achieved forgiveness show more investment in their marriages, greater closeness, a more equal balance of power, and higher levels of marital adjustment compared with couples who haven’t reached forgiveness. However, forgiveness is just the beginning of the long recovery process from infidelity. It will help you build your relationship from the ground up, but you both must continue to work on increased intimacy, communication, trust, and relationship satisfaction. Relationships can be very difficult at times, but if you decide to work together through infidelity and other issues, your relationship can be restored and even strengthened.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>by Mackenzie Arnold</strong></p>\n<p>From getting the kids ready for school, school drop offs, working 9-5, soccer practices and dance recitals, helping the kids with homework, making dinner, and getting the kids ready for bed, it’s no wonder that couples often complain that they do not have enough quality time together. Well, luckily for us, COVID-19 brought us PLENTY of time to spend together &#8211; or are we really so lucky? Is it too much time? If you’re now finding yourself complaining of having too much quality time with your partner, don’t worry &#8211; you are not alone. COVID-19 is a difficult time for couples to navigate through and we are here to provide you with some tips on how to help your relationship thrive during this stressful, scary time.</p>\n<h2><strong>Create Separate Space</strong></h2>\n<p>It is okay to not be together all the time. According to Robert Levenson, a psychology professor of the Berkeley Graduate School, it is important to give yourselves some alone time to be able to “recharge” yourselves and your relationship. It is common for couples to fight more when they are cooped up together under stress. Dr. Arthur Aron, a research professor in psychology, says it can be helpful to separate yourselves during the day while you are working, doing household chores, etc. It’s a good idea to try to find separate spaces to do your work during the day, so you aren’t cramping each other’s style.</p>\n<p>Chris Kraft, a psychologist, says that incorporating some self-care can also be great for recharging yourself and helping de-stress. Do a face mask, watch your favorite tv show, read a book, or any activity that you enjoy. Incorporating some sort of exercise into daily life is also of upmost significance right now when normal exercise like walking around your office, going to the grocery store, climbing flights of stairs in your work building, etc. have been diminished to much less frequency. Whether it be a high intensity workout, a stroll around your neighborhood, yoga, meditation, or whatever your preference may be, including exercise is always a good idea.</p>\n<h2><strong>Be Understanding</strong></h2>\n<p>During this time, it is important to understand that emotions are high, and everyone reacts to stress in different ways. If your partner is having a hard time coping with the very difficult times we are in, be understanding, ask what you can do to help, help out with some of the chores you don’t normally do. Allow your partner to lean on you more now than ever if they need it! Additionally, try not to expect too much from your partner right now. We have lost a lot and they may be grieving normal life, which may make it harder for them to be on their best relationship behavior right now. So, cut them some slack and give them some time to cope.</p>\n<h2><strong>Communicate Effectively</strong></h2>\n<p>The phrase “communication is key” is so commonly known because it is so true! This is true especially during quarantine where emotions are elevated and stressors are abundant, it is necessary to be open and honest in communication with your partner. Bundling up your emotions and holding them inside in a time like this can be detrimental to your relationship. If your partner is doing something to make you upset or there is more that they can be doing to help your relationship/family, tell them! Being upfront and honest with your partner can help avoid a heated outburst from occurring and escalating both of your stress levels even more.</p>\n<p>A helpful tip for all relationships, not just romantic relationships during quarantine, is to use “I statements” instead of “You statements.” It is beneficial to start a statement by saying “I feel” instead of saying “you…” because “You statements” may make someone feel like they are being personally attacked. For example, instead of saying “You never want to have romantic date nights with me,” you could say something along the lines of “I would love it if we could plan some more sweet date nights together; it would mean a lot to me.”</p>\n<h2><strong>Plan Safe, Fun Date Nights</strong></h2>\n<p>Although the times of extravagant, fun date nights may be on hold right now, it is still important to have time set aside for amusing, quality time together (while still being safe). Barbara Rickey, MS, LPCC, suggests that you find a new show/movie to watch on a streaming service, cook a nice dinner together, have a sunset picnic in your car, play a new game, etc. Be creative and even surprise each other, says Madeline Howard, a writer for <em>Women’s Health Magazine</em>. Surprising one another with a cute, exciting activity to do together is one of the best ways to make your partner feel loved and special during these times.</p>\n<h2><strong>Keep Sex in Your Schedules</strong></h2>\n<p>Sex is known to be beneficial for your health for several reasons like improved memory, better-quality sleep, reducing stress hormone levels, burning calories, and more. Indeed, we know that sexual activity even boosts immunity – which is good news in the days of COVID-19! Regular sexual activity increase antibodies that help immune systems fight off infections better. Besides the health benefits, sexual activity is also beneficial to keeping a close, intimate relationship with your partner. Agreement, understanding, and cooperation between partners is shown to be much better and healthier after sexual activity has taken place than before. Likewise, when couples are satisfied sexually in their relationship, they are more likely to report feeling satisfied and happy with their relationship and life as a whole.</p>\n<h2><strong>Stick to Your Routines</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the best ways to keep yourselves in check mentally and physically during quarantine, is to set routines for yourself. According to Gigi Engle, sexologist and author of <em>All the F*cking Mistakes: A Guide to Sex, Love, and Life</em>, sticking to a routine can help eliminate the panic and fear that may be rising inside you. Help yourself (and your partner) by setting a time to wake up, to get your work done, to do self-care, to do household chores, to spend time together, and to go to bed. Having a normal routine will help life feel more “normal” in a time where life can see aimless and dull. This will help you both feel less stressed, increasing the quality of your relationship and time spent together.</p>\n<h2><strong>Additional Advice</strong></h2>\n<p>If you and your partner are having a difficult time coping together right now, it is okay to seek help! Many psychologists and therapists are offering virtual counseling sessions and are willing to help more patients. Therapy is a great and effective way to help support relationships with ourselves and with others. It is important to recognize when you need help and it is never too late to seek help of any kind either. In addition to in-person services, there are several online resources available to you. <a href=\"http://OurRelationship.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OurRelationship.com</a> – recently recognized as the “Best Overall” relationship counseling platform by <a href=\"http://OnlineTherapy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OnlineTherapy.com</a> – offers free or low-cost brief services to couples and has been shown to be effective in several studies.

Socially interacting with others has drastically changed before our eyes. Many people are working from home, bars and clubs are closed, and hanging out with friends is not as frequent or care-free as it used to be. With establishments being closed and many people staying home, we have had to change our routines and adjust to this new lifestyle. Assuming you are living with your significant other, one of those adjustments is being around each other more often. Depending on your relationship, this can either be a good or a bad thing. Nonetheless, it is important to take this new abundance of time with your partner to explore your relationship and keep it thriving during this tough time. Here are some tips to keep the romance alive during the pandemic:</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Take Each Other on Dates:</strong></span></h2>\n<p>Since popular date night spots, like the movies and bowling alleys, are not open or particularly safe to go to right now, it is easy to choose to stay home rather than go out with your partner. However, do not fall into this trap. This should be your opportunity to use your imagination and come up with out of the box ideas for dates. They do not have to be fancy or expensive. They just need to be enjoyable outings both of you will appreciate. Make time for dates at least once a week. Take turns coming up with dates to impress your partner. It is important to get out of the house and, if applicable, away from your kids. Giving undivided attention to your partner and making new memories is beneficial to increasing the strength of your relationship. Your partner knowing that you put thought and effort into the date is a recipe for success.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Don&#8217;t Smother Each Other:</strong></span></h2>\n<p>It is easy to be all over each other when you are both at home. Adjusting to working at home with your partner can be difficult as well. Avoid invading each other’s personal space all of the time. You both need to establish a daily routine &#8211; relatively similar to the one you had before the pandemic occurred. Try starting a new project, working out, doing yoga, or FaceTime your friends. Do something that you love and communicate with others, so that you can stay productive throughout your day and not put pressure on your partner to fulfill your whole sense of self and purpose. Everyone needs different environments and social groups to fulfill needs that their partners can’t or are unable to meet. Capitalize on this newfound time of being at home and carve out some personal time for yourself.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Support Your Partner, Especially When They Are Struggling:</strong></span></h2>\n<p>This pandemic has made life hard for many people. Many have come down with the coronavirus themselves or know someone who has experienced debilitating symptoms. Businesses have had to close down, employees have been laid off, unemployment benefits have been hard to obtain, and people are unable to go outside, see their friends/loved ones, and live a normal life. Mental health concerns have risen due to the sudden isolations everyone has had to endure. Make sure you are supporting your partner during this time, especially if they have been directly affected by the pandemic. Try giving your partner “invisible support” by removing stressors from their life that they may not be consciously aware of. If they are having a bad day, make sure you do something that will cheer them up. If they just got laid off and are worried about money, do not go frivolously spending on unnecessary items. Give them the reassurance that things will get better and that you will support them every step of the way. However, do not lose sight of yourself trying to fulfill your partner’s needs. Celebrate the moments of success they see along the way, and be sure to stay positive and remain genuine with your support.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Communication:</strong></span></h2>\n<p>Strong communication is the foundation for every good relationship. It is necessary to communicate with your partner about grievances you may have, problems you need to solve, or just random events that occurred throughout your day. It is also important to express interest about your partner’s day and wellbeing. Your and your partner’s lives have been suddenly changed by the pandemic, so it is more important than ever to communicate how it has affected you and your relationship. You can’t expect your partner to read your mind. They might not be aware of the effect of their actions. Remember that you are not the only one in the relationship whose needs and wants are important. Create an environment that is open for sharing. Make sure you are receptive to any criticism that may come your way. Do not come in with a negative attitude. Once negativity, blame, and insults are introduced into the conversation, it is no longer proper communication. Respectfully express your needs to your partner in an effective manner. Make sure you are being direct about what you need so that your partner can properly comprehend the problem and make any necessary adjustments. Be sure to praise them when they make the effort to change the things that upset you.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Remember Why You Chose Your Partner:</strong></span></h2>\n<p>Take a trip down memory lane. Recall the first time you two met. Think about your wedding night and bring out the wedding album. Get nostalgic about your honeymoon. Think of the reasons why you love your partner and why you decided they were the one you wanted to spend the rest of your life with. If you are not married, think about all of the major events that brought you two together. It is in this moment that you should see the good that this relationship has to offer and has been offering you.</p>\n<p>Try to implement these tips while you are cooped up at home with your spouse. This is a great time to evaluate your relationship and make any necessary changes while you are both constantly around each other. Research shows that an increase in intimacy, satisfaction, passion, and investment has a positive impact on a partner’s perception of their relationship, viewing it as longer-lasting and more serious. We all want a successful relationship. Let&#8217;s make sure we are putting in the time and effort to achieve it!</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Infidelity—or cheating—is a very common concern among people in monogamous or exclusive relationships. After all, it has been estimated that up to 36% of American adults have been cheated on by a partner in the past. Before we discuss why people cheat in their relationships, it’s important to define what constitutes cheating in the first place.</p>\n<p>The truth is, what makes a person unfaithful to their partner means something different for each of us. For some, activities such as watching pornography alone or masturbating alone could be viewed as unfaithful behavior. For others, cheating could refer to dressing to attract the sexual attention of others, receiving close emotional support by someone else of their desired gender, or kissing someone on the cheek. Many might not view these behaviors or actions as unfaithful, instead seeing actions such as sexting, flirting, browsing dating profiles, or masturbating over a webcam with another person as cheating. Despite these differences of opinion, the vast majority of Americans agree that engaging in any sexual activity (kissing, sexual touch, giving or receiving oral sex, vaginal or anal intercourse) would be viewed as definitely cheating.</p>\n<p>Because most couples just assume that they’re in an exclusive relationship without talking about it with their partners, we probably don’t even have a sense of how our partner even defines infidelity. That’s bound to result in some conflict! The solution? Have a chat about it with your partner: where’s the line for them? Where’s the line for you?</p>\n<h2>Whose relationship is at risk?</h2>\n<p>The short and uncomfortable answer is, anyone could cheat or be cheated on. The long answer is, researchers have determined that there are some traits that are more commonly associated with cheating. First, couples who are less committed to one another are more likely to experience infidelity; which means that married couples are least at-risk compared to couples are who merely dating or dating and living together. However, commitment aside, there are also important behaviors to look out for. The primary behavior is communication: couples who are unable to have difficult conversations needed to maintain, repair, or end their relationship—or couples who use invalidating and negative communication styles are most likely to cheat. Second, partners who do not feel validated or appreciated by their partners are more likely to seek validation elsewhere. The other most important factor is situational: those who encounter or put themselves in more risky “slippery slope” situations (spending extensive time away from partner, having close relationships with possible partners such as friends or coworkers, drinking or taking drugs to lower inhibitions) are at greater risk for cheating.</p>\n<p>If we put together the individual risks (e.g., feeling neglected or rejected by partner; wanting reassurance) and the risks at the relationship level (e.g., poor and reduced communication, deteriorating sex life, avoidance of conflict), they will combine to make infidelity far more likely if either partner encounters or creates opportunities to be sexually or emotionally close with others.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Sex is seemingly all around us, everywhere we look: it’s on our television sets, all over the internet, in movies, in books and magazines, on the news, in politics. Hearing and reading about it tends to grab our attention; it’s exciting, it’s titillating. But when it comes to having sex in our own relationships, we may be less inclined to engage. There are a number of known barriers that prevent us from having the sex-lives we want—whether it’s a function of there not being enough hours in the day, or difficulty communicating each other’s sexual needs and desires in the relationship. But even without those barriers in place, we all have different drives and motivations for sex.</p>\n<p>According to a notable group of psychology researchers in the US, there are upwards of 200 different reasons why Americans choose to have sex in their relationships at any given time: to seek pleasure, reduce stress, to feel attractive, to feel closer to one’s partner, to express appreciation, to prevent a negative outcome—the list goes on. Of course, there are also couples who use it for procreation and family planning. Generally speaking, though, we are living in an age where many of us take great preventive measures to avoid pregnancy. So why is sex so important in our relationships?</p>\n<h2>It Can Strengthen The bond In Your Relationship</h2>\n<p>Have you ever felt like engaging in sexual activity with your partner made you feel closer or more intimately connected? It may surprise you to know that the reasons why are scientific. Each time a couple has sex, there are electrical signals fired in the brain that motivate each partner to stay with that person and care for them. Even when we are just sexually aroused or excited, we are more likely to seek compromise and cooperation with our partner and make sacrifices for them. As humans, we are wired to find a life-partner and commit to making the relationship work.</p>\n<p>We even know that couples tend to report greater relationship satisfaction after sex. However, there’s a catch. If the motivation for sexual activity is positive (for example, for pleasure, for greater intimacy), you are far more likely to feel more satisfied in your relationship after doing the act. On the other hand, though, if the motivation for sexual activity is to avoid conflict or consequence (for example, to keep a partner interested or stop a fight from escalating), you are more likely to be less satisfied and less committed in the relationship. Actually, so can your partner: Being aware that our partner is just doing it to avoid conflict is—after all—not very sexy. So, while sex can bring us closer to our partner, it only works if you’re doing it for the right reasons.</p>\n<h2>It Can Protect Your Relationship From Insecurity</h2>\n<p>Sometimes we feel insecure in our relationships—maybe we’re feeling bad about ourselves, or something at work isn’t going well. Or maybe we’re starting to question whether our partner is truly committed to us. Insecurity can lead us to be more attention-seeking, defensive, or aggressive with our partners—which can lead to real conflict in the relationship. Some people who experience significant anxiety in their close relationships may have what we call an “anxious attachment style.” Attachment styles are developed early in life based on our upbringing and our relationships with the individuals that raised us. Does this sound like it matches you or your partner?</p>\n<p>As it turns out, couples who have more satisfying sex tend to report less insecurity in their relationships. Feeling highly intimate with our partners not only makes us feel more satisfied with our partner, it can also make us feel less anxious about the relationship in general.</p>\n<h2>It’s Good For Your Health</h2>\n<p>So far, we’ve talked about the benefits for your relationship and intimate connection. But there is a neat little benefit to regular, satisfying sexual activity: it’s actually good for your physical health!</p>\n<p>Frequent and satisfying sexual activity can increase the number of antibodies in your body—and since antibodies help prevent infection, that means your immune system functions better. Other health benefits include (but are not limited to) reduced risk of heart disease, improved cognition and memory, lower cholesterol, improvements in sleep, and fewer reports of muscle and joint pain. We’ve even learned that per minute, men tend to burn 4.2 calories while women tend to burn 3.1 calories—that’s a third of what we burn during a 30-minute session on the treadmill!</p>\n<p>From these 3 reasons alone, engaging in sexual activity with your partner has some serious benefits. Remember, though, you will only benefit from these effects if the sex is satisfying and initiated for the right reasons; anything that is physically and/or emotionally unpleasant is not going to provide these benefits. Make sure to get to know your needs and practice talking to your partner openly and honestly about them.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>It’s almost impossible think about romantic relationships without thinking of sex. Sex is indeed a fundamental part of intimate relationships: it’s fun and often satisfying, it emotionally connects us to our partner, it can help bolster relationship commitment, and it even has some serious health benefits (decades of research indicates that it can reduce stress, burn calories, improve cardiovascular health, and extend our overall life expectancy!). That seems like enough to convince you that sex is unquestionably a major positive for your relationship, right?</p>\n<p>Well, would you believe that married couples these days seem to be having it less and less? I don’t mean that as your relationship progresses, you and your partner do it less often. I mean that all married couples in the United States—across gender, race, geographic region, and education level—are having less sex per year than married couples did in the 90’s, 2000’s, and 2010’s. So much for all the progress we made for sexual freedom and expression, 2020!</p>\n<p>So, if sex is so great, why aren’t married people having more of it?</p>\n<h2>Finding the Time in your Busy Day</h2>\n<p>It may not come as a surprise to know that one of the primary reasons people in relationships report having sex less frequently than they’d like is because of time. When we finally fall into bed at night, sometimes we’re too exhausted to muster up the energy for anything other than sleeping. Here are a just a few reasons why…</p>\n<p>When we look at statistics, it turns out we are actually spending more time at work and more time parenting our children than in generations past. If you think about it, it makes sense. It is more normal than ever before in history for women to have a job or career outside the home, so it is increasingly rare for one member of the household to be a homemaker (which, by the way, is a job all in its own!). As job markets get more competitive and businesses look to save money, the demands at work increase exponentially. If you put that together, not only are you and your partner likely to have less time at home, you’ll like have more chores to take care of when you finally do get home.</p>\n<p>With parenting, we can also understand the recent increase in demand. The hours your grandparents spent raising your parents was likely limited to cooking and cleaning. School was less competitive; there was no “screen time” to manage and patrol; playtime was spent freely outdoors. Thanks to the rise of technology and the increased emphasis on wellbeing and safety, we spend hours each day making sure our kids finish their homework, eat enough nutritious foods, have fun and organized playdates, and are engaged in and safety transported to and from their afterschool activities. This is, of course, on top of the shopping, cooking, and cleaning. I’m tired just thinking about it all…</p>\n<p>Where are we getting these extra hours in the day? Well, of course. We’re taking it out of our relationships. We have less alone time, less time to have meaningful and intimate conversation, and less time to physically connect.</p>\n<p>It is easy to let sex slide from your routine. While there is no easy solution, having a better understanding of and empathy for where your time is being spent can be a good first step. It is okay to be too tired. Allow that to relieve some of the pressure to get it on. A second step is to talk about it with your partner. Come up with a signal or keyword when you each find a brief period of alone time. Don’t expect to find hours of your week that can be devoted to sex. Got hours? Great! Got minutes? Sometimes a “quickie” here and there is enough to spark some serious excitement and bring some fun and spontaneity back to the relationship.</p>\n<h2>The Division of Household Chores in your Relationship</h2>\n<p>In opposite-sex relationships, household chores tend to fall disproportionately on women. Once upon a time, this was actually beneficial for couples’ physical intimacy. In the 1980’s and even 1990’s, couples who divided household chores based on traditional gender roles (women: shopping, cooking, cleaning; men: paying bills, driving, lawn maintenance) actually reported having more frequent sex.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, times have changed. In the 2000’s, 2010’s, and now in 2020, we have seemed to more or less blurred the lines between “male” and “female” chores. We may feel more equal to our opposite-sex partners and, as a result, we feel that the division of labor in the relationship is more fairly split. And wouldn’t you know—when we experience more equality in our relationships, we feel more connected to our partners, more sexually attracted to our partners, and are more sexually active.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the division of household chores in your relationship. It could explain why you’ve been feeling your sex life slow down.</p>\n<h2>Pornography Use in your Relationship</h2>\n<p>Pornography—any type of media featuring nudity or behavior that is intended to cause sexual arousal—has always been a part of human history. But the internet has made it easily accessible, immediately available, free, and even mainstream. There is a lot of ongoing research about the effects of porn use on relationship wellbeing. In short, it has its benefits and its consequences.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the consequences. With frequent pornography use, our expectations for what “normal sex” looks like are prone to shift. It is all too easy to forget that the people you see on your screen represent unrealistic beauty standards, are heavily-edited and choreographed, and are performing for the camera. If we don’t keep those important facts in mind, watching pornography can make intimacy with your partner feel lackluster. Through research, we know that straight men who watch porn more frequently tend to report lower relationship satisfaction with their female partners compared to men who watch porn less frequently. And across genders, frequent individual porn use can make us feel less committed to our partners as we visualize ourselves with other people in fantasy. Don’t panic—the old adage still applies here: everything in moderation will not harm you.</p>\n<p>Now, what are the benefits? A lot of the negatives of porn use are focused on individual consumption—that is, porn that is viewed alone without one’s partner. We happen to know that couples who use porn together in their relationships report more satisfaction with their sex lives than partners who use porn on their own. We tend to see that couples who are open to using pornography together in their relationships are more likely to communicate openly about their sexual desires, wishes, needs, and interests. Better sexual communication = more satisfying sex, and more satisfying sex = increased desire.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that pornography is not for everyone. If you or your partner are uncomfortable about using porn, that does not mean your sexual enjoyment is doomed. Viewing porn together will only help if it is something you are both interested in experiencing together.</p>\n<h2>Communicating our Needs</h2>\n<p>The final obstacle is in communicating our sexual needs. Some couples have no problem openly sharing their needs and desires in bed; other couples may find it absolutely terrifying to talk about. “What will my partner think?” “Will they judge me?” We have been taught in American society that talking about sex and intimacy is embarrassing and maybe even wrong. Maybe some don’t even feel like we deserve to have our needs met.</p>\n<p>It is inevitable that you and your partner—no matter how sexually compatible—will have moments where only one of you is aroused or interested in engaging. Or maybe the type of sexual activity your partner is interested in is just not doing it for you right now. That’s perfectly normal. We all have different needs and desires at different times.</p>\n<p>When this happens—when one partner wants to engage in sexual activity and the other does not—we have the freedom of choice. We can choose to engage despite our lack of initial interest—maybe to avoid hurting our partner’s feelings or maybe in the hopes that engaging will awaken our own desire. Or we can choose to honor our own needs and reject our partner’s sexual advance. It can be difficult to find the right way to “reject” an advance with our partner. If you’re concerned about hurting your partner’s feelings or inciting conflict in the relationship, try “positive rejection strategies” such as telling your partner that you love them and are attracted to them, but are just not in the mood. By reassuring our partners in the moment, we can both honor our own needs and avoid hurting our partners’ feelings. There’s even been research to show that positive sexual rejections in relationships can lead to improved sexual satisfaction!</p>\n<p>If you are experiencing coercion in your relationship—that is, if you feel you are being or have been manipulated verbally or physically into sexual activity with your partner—it may be especially difficult to navigate communication around sex. Your desires and needs are important and you deserve to feel sexually safe in your relationship.

      "rendered": "<h2>The Once-a-Day Relationship Challenge</h2>\n<p>Have you ever heard of the once-a-day challenge? It’s a challenge where couples commit to having sex every day for a week, a month, 100 days, or even a year unless one partner is sick, traveling, or uses the escape clause to particularly decline. Some benefits couples find from this is committing to daily sex allows for couples to explore sexual desires they normally wouldn’t because instead of figuring out whether or not to have sex, they have to figure out how to. Many who take on this challenge enjoy feeling healthy and relaxed, the endorphins sex rowels up are great and can leave people feeling younger. Sexual desire and sexual interaction distinguish intimate relationships from other interpersonal relationships but what comes first? Does a healthy, satisfying sex life improve and strengthen a relationship or does a healthy, satisfying relationship improve sexual satisfaction?</p>\n<h2>Sexual Satisfaction and Relationship Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>The internet gives us many things, including descriptions of explicit sexuality and people blogging, bragging, and complaining about their sex lives. A big part of our identities includes the type of sex we pursue and how we pursue it. However, even in a cultural landscape saturated with sex, research in 59 countries found most people have sex within the context of an intimate relationship. Many people believe you can’t have a satisfying intimate relationship without a satisfying sex life. Adults of all ages in the United States rate faithfulness and a happy sex life as the most important aspect of a successful relationship, especially in marriage. They even rate it far more important in the relationship than sharing household chores, money, housing, religious beliefs, shared interests and hobbies, children, and agreement on politics. Relationship satisfaction is the product of an overall evaluation of a relationship and sexual satisfaction is each partner’s evaluation of the sex life a relationship has. The responses to questions about both seem to overlap. People who report being more satisfied with the sexual aspect of their relationship report being more satisfied with their relationship as a whole. This is true for young and old, same-sex and different-sex, relationships and marriages all over the world with personal beliefs that prioritize the sexual part of relationships. For example, people who think oral sex is important care more about giving or getting oral sex compared to people who don’t value it as much.</p>\n<p>There are many factors that play a role. Attachment styles are a factor. People with an anxious attachment style are more affected by the quality of sexual interactions they have with their partners on a given day than people with a secure attachment style. People with an avoidant attachment style are less affected. Gender is another factor. Men have a stronger association between sexual and relationship satisfaction than women do even though sex is consistently significant for both. Longitudinal research has studied how relationship and sexual satisfaction change over time. In the early years of a relationship, sexual satisfaction predicts changes in relationship satisfaction. For example, newlywed’s satisfaction with their relationship and sexual satisfaction affect each other in both directions. Relationships where partners are just getting to know each other are more affected by sexual satisfaction while they are discovering what they each like and dislike. Couples who are able to connect sexually early on develop a deeper bond, on average, than couples who aren’t able to as easily. As for established relationships, couples married 10 years and 30 years on average have a reliable association between their initial levels of sexual satisfaction and changes in their relationship satisfaction. For men and women, no matter the stage a relationship is in, a couple’s sex life predicts the course of the committed relationship. On the other hand, the older a couple gets, the less their relationship satisfaction will change their sexual behaviors. Often times, after a couple has been together for more than a decade their sex life becomes predictable and although sexual satisfaction still predicts changes in relationship satisfaction, relationship satisfaction will no longer predict changes in sexual satisfaction or behaviors.</p>\n<h2>Relationships Without Sex</h2>\n<p>Can a relationship be satisfying without sex? Yes! There are millions of people that wait until marriage to have sex. Some for religious reasons, some for personal reasons that don’t involve religion or spirituality at all. People can have satisfying romantic relationships without sex or sexual attraction whether they identify as being asexual or not. For most people, some sort of sexual interaction is essential to fulfilling intimacy, but it is possible to voluntarily abstain from having sex and be satisfied with a relationship. People who are involuntarily celibate for a long time against their will are rarely satisfied with their relationships but may stay in them for other reasons. A walk in the park, cooking together, or any other shared behavior cannot substitute sex. Sex is often something only shared between intimate partners in a relationship. It often defines what being intimate with someone else means, especially in popular culture, but it is not the only way to attain intimacy with someone. There are various ways to be intimate with someone outside of physical intimacy. Chances are, the better the emotional intimacy in a relationship is, the better the sex in the relationship will be.</p>\n<p>One effect of an increased number of people valuing satisfying sex is that virginity is no longer as attractive as it used to be in mainstream society. It makes sense, when the purpose of sex was primarily reproduction, people sought out partners with little or no sexual experience. Now, people assume that experienced partners will be better lovers and the remaining a virgin until marriage is less common. That being said, too much sexual experience can also be a turn-off. On average, college students around 21 years old want their prospective partners to have a handful of previous partners, to be experienced enough to know their desires and preferences, but not have more than a handful of partners.</p>\n<h2>The Course of Sexual Desire in Relationships</h2>\n<p>Long-term relationships present couples with what can feel like a trade-off. Sexual desire tends to be aroused by new experiences and risk but commitment to a relationship tends to be reinforced by feelings of familiarity and security. The trade-off is that the safer and more reliable a relationship becomes, the less sexy it becomes. This especially echoes with women seeking help for their low sexual desire. Women often report that the security of knowing how much their partners love them and feeling comfortable taking their clothes off fades the excitement that once accompanied their sex lives and they lose sexual desire. On average, sexual desire does not decrease for women and men and yet as couples get older, they tend to have less sex. The major cause for this is what happens as we age, especially to men. Changes in the relationship are another major reason. If relationship satisfaction declines over time, sexual satisfaction, and the frequency of sexual interactions will decline. Even so, surveys conducted in the United States and Germany controlling for the effects of age and relationship satisfaction confirm that sexual frequency and satisfaction tend to peak in the first year of a relationship and decline in the second year. Fortunately, these studies found the decline to level off after the second year. What continued to change was the feeling of lust for a partner depending on the emotional climate of the relationship on a particular day. This doesn’t mean that couples have to choose between passion and security in their relationship. On average, declines in sexual desire aren’t inevitable nor universal. Even age-related declines in sexual desire are significantly smaller for people in better relationships. Relationships take work but it is possible to maintain a healthy and satisfying sex life within a stable and secure long-term relationship regardless of age.</p>\n<h2>Ingredients of a Healthy Sex Life in Relationships</h2>\n<p>For centuries, people have made all kinds of pills, ointments, and tools to guarantee sexual satisfaction. Spoiler alert, it’s not that simple! One of the most common complaints from couples, especially heterosexual males, is that they don’t have enough sex. In western and sexually liberated countries like the United States and non-western countries like Iran and China, simply having more sex can lead to more satisfaction and fewer complaints. Among newlyweds, the more couples report having sex, the more sexually satisfied they are over the next 4 years. Furthermore, partners are more satisfied the more time they spend having sex, and the longer their average sexual encounter lasts independently of how much sex they have. The association between sexual frequency and general happiness doesn’t follow a straight line. Sure, rarely having sex is linked to being less happy compared to having sex regularly, but how often do people who have sex regularly actually have sex? People who have sex on a weekly basis are happier than people who don’t, but people who have sex more than once a week aren’t much happier than people who have sex once a week. Quantity isn’t everything.</p>\n<h2>Quantity of Sex in Relationships</h2>\n<p>Just because the quantity of sex is linked to greater satisfaction doesn’t mean that having more sex will make a sexual relationship more satisfying. If you’re having amazing sex, you’re likely to want to have sex more often. Having sex more often might be a result of sexual satisfaction, not the cause. An experiment with a sample of 128 heterosexual married couples who reported having sex between once a month was conducted to measure positive moods and study the relationships. The couples were split into two groups. The first group was directed to double the amount of sex they usually had, and the other group didn’t receive any instructions. The couples completed an online questionnaire for the next 90 days. Having more sex did not lead the first group, assigned to double the amount of sex they had, to experience more positive emotions. In fact, compared to the couples who weren’t instructed to change their sexual behaviors, the couples who were instructed to increase the amount of sex they had were less happy by the end of the study. Even though the first group was having more sex, they were enjoying it less and possibly experiencing less sexual desire as a result. Sexual satisfaction heavily depends on why you’re having sex. If you’re having sex to express desire and passion, it’s a turn on. If you’re having sex like it’s a chore, it’s a turn-off. Couples struggling to conceive a child know the pressure to have a certain amount of sex at a certain time of the month to maximize fertility often takes the fun and excitement out of having sex. Couples who participate in the once-a-day challenge often reflect learning this same lesson.</p>\n<h2>Sexual Technique in Relationships</h2>\n<p>Have you ever heard of Kama Sutra? It’s one of the oldest and most popular examples of manuals and guides offered to advise people on how to best please their partners and improve their sex life. Unbeknownst to many, only one out of the thirty-six chapters in Kama Sutra is actually dedicated to sexual practices and the illustrations of various sex positions commonly featured in magazines and phone applications. Guides like Kama Sutra don’t tell couples to have more sex, they promise to improve the quality of sex couples are having. Kama Sutra does this by identifying specific techniques to make sex more satisfying, which a skilled lover would know, and an unskilled lover could learn. Kama Sutra hasn’t really been scientifically studied, but there are sexual behaviors that are reliably associated with greater sexual satisfaction. For example, the more people consistently reach orgasm, the more sexually satisfied they are. For men, sexual satisfaction is higher the more consistently their partner reaches orgasm. For women, it isn’t, presumably because there’s little variability in men experiencing orgasm. Women and men who report greater sexual satisfaction and more regular orgasms are more likely to report engaging in mutual masturbation, oral sex, and penile-vaginal intercourse. However, there aren’t specific techniques that are universally found to be crucial for a satisfying sex life. The greater the variety, the more satisfied women and men are. Another factor associated with sexual satisfaction in relationships is what couples do right before and right after they have sex. Take a moment to think. How often do you and your partner set the mood by dimming the lights, playing music, or engaging in some sexy talk? How often do you and your partner cuddle and express affection after you have sex? Even after accounting for how long sex lasts or how often couples have sex, women and men are more sexually satisfied the more they spend time bonding and enjoying time together after sex. Our behaviors don’t just affect how our partner physically feels and possibly sexually please them. Our behaviors affect how we make our partner feel emotionally. The key to sexual satisfaction is not necessarily sexual skills, but enthusiasm for a sexual connection and an interest in pleasing our partner.</p>\n<h2>Responsiveness in Relationships</h2>\n<p>Aside from technically competent genital stimulation, women report the highest levels of sexual satisfaction when they are in a committed relationship. Sexperts rarely emphasize specific sexual techniques and shine a spotlight on the importance of being mindfully present, feeling connected, mutual respect, and good communication. Understandings the quality of a relationships’ sex life requires understanding how partners relate to each other daily. Relationships where couples are happy with communication are relationships where couples stay more sexually satisfied over time. Regardless of how much they have sex, couples are more satisfied with their sex lives the more they report positive behaviors, and the less they report negative ones. For example, expressing approval, complimenting, and not dominating conversations or arguing all the time will improve sexual satisfaction even if nothing else in a relationship’s sex life changes. Great communication is super sexy! We’re most likely to feel understood, validated, and cared for by our partners when they’re responsive. When our partners’ actions to our disclosures and vulnerability meet and exceed our desires and goals, we’re happier. Independent from the general level of relationship satisfaction, the more responsive partners are to each other, the stronger their sexual desire will be for each other. Responsive partners make each other feel wanted, desired, special, and unique. Responsive partners are perceived to be more attractive to their partners and to people outside of the relationship. Regardless of spiritual, religious, political, cultural, racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and other differences, responsiveness is a universal turn-on. We want our partners to understand, validate, and care for us when we are afraid or disappointed, and we also want them to be responsive when we express sexual desire and arousal. The more partners invest time in understanding each other and their sexual preferences, the more they’ll enjoy their sex lives. Instead of spending your time looking for the perfect lover, invest your time in creating and nourishing the perfect love.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In a relationship, when you share a vulnerable expression with your partner you may feel anxious on how they respond. Opening up your heart and your life to your partner for the very first time can be nerve wracking. You might have had a negative previous experience with a past partner leading you to have a more difficult time opening up. But you must remember how important intimacy is to your relationship. Intimacy can be created through communication by disclosing vulnerabilities. Once your partner opens up to you about something, that is sharing a moment with you in being vulnerable. Being vulnerable with your partner is fundamental to building intimacy. Communication is a wonderful way to deepen your intimate connection while building trust on the way. Communicating about vulnerable past events or disclosing something that has been weighing you down can build the skills necessary to address sensitive events in the future. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Responding to disclosure in a relationship:</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fear from not knowing how your partner will respond may stop some people from sharing things that make them feel vulnerable. But disclosing and seeing how your partner responds can help you determine if there is a long-term future with this person. If they respond dismissively and do not listen to you then that might mirror a future response pattern leading to poor relationship compatible. However, if they respond with love, comfort, and understanding your intimate connection will deepen. Now you know you can turn to this person to help manage times of crisis and they will express genuine concern. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Intimate Process Model:</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The intimate process model can better help you understand how intimacy help the development of relationships. Intimacy generally is cultivated when there are interactions when one partner is disclosing thoughts and feelings that may make them vulnerable. Common examples of disclosures are parental divorce, loss of a loved one, or another traumatic event. Disclosures can also be present hardships such as having a poor work evaluation. The intimacy process model works when the partner responses in a way that communicates that they are listening and deepening their knowledge of your true self. Your true self or also known as the inner self is encompassed by your needs, beliefs, and emotions. In your relationship, your partner discovers your inner, vulnerable self by when you disclose and reveal feelings and thoughts that make you vulnerable. Your partner knowing your inner self is important to build intimacy, especially for later stages in the relationship when you may encounter new challenges. The second part of the model is that your partner makes you feel validated and respects you in response to your vulnerable disclosure. The third part is that your partner responds in a way that makes it apparent that they care about you and your wellbeing. These three processes past through an interpretative filter which shapes both of your perceptions on the communication leading to the overall feelings of being understood, validated, and cared for. The interpretative filter plays the role of how your partner will respond to your disclosure. We look to our partners to be responsive during vulnerable times. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Responsive behaviors include four steps:</b></span></h2>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Listen to your partners initial disclosure</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Understand both the meaning of the words on a fundamental level and on a deeper level</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Responding to the disclosures in an understanding way, while asking questions to gain even deeper intimacy</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Being mindful of whether, when and how to transition to another topic to make sure you are not being dismissive</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Responsiveness and Empathy in Relationships:</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Empathy is the umbrella under which responsiveness falls. Empathy means having the capacity for understanding and sharing in another person’s feelings and thoughts. The interpretative filter guides the degree of sensitivity to your partner’s disclosure. Even if your partner may think they are being responsive and empathetic to your intimate disclosure, you have an interpretative filter too which may determine a different meaning and impact of their attempt at intimacy. Our attempt of responding with empathetic behaviors will not be felt unless our partner experiences them that way. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If any step in the intimacy process model fails, such as lack of responsiveness or faulty interpretative filter then the whole model crashes. To make sure you communicate with intimacy, it is important to make your responsiveness resonate with your partner’s mode of communication. So they understand the genuine sincerity of your words. Picking up on times when your partners’ interpretative filter did not register the intent of your reaction and analyzing what was miscommunicated by having an open and honest dialogue is important to making sure the interpretative filter did not jumble what you truly meant. Most of the time caring, understanding, and words of validation are experienced in the way they were mean to. However, sometimes there is a gap between what you say and what your partner takes from what you said which weakens the relationship. Honest communication through times when interpretative filters may confuse intention is necessary to get back on the right track. You may have had an experience of complimenting your partner, but the wording confused the interpretative filter and they took it as a back handed compliment. Getting to the route meaning behind and stating intentions are good strategies to employ when miscommunication is heighten.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why does one feel the urge to disclose in the first place? </b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Well most people want to share thoughts and feelings that make them vulnerable when their motives, goals, needs, and fears come into play. Showing our true self is a process that takes time just like the intimacy process model. Knowing the time and place to disclose also plays a role in how the disclosure effects the level of intimacy in the relationship. Some partners share traumatic experiences on the first date which may be overwhelming and scare off their potential partner.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Others may tell their partner a story that might not be all accurate. Both of these types of disclosures, too quick and inaccurate, do not strengthen intimacy nor build the relationship. There needs to be a foundation to share disclosures so both partners feel safe and ready to accept the other partner letting their guard down. Self-revealing disclosures brings your partner into your zone of privacy. Traditionally we think of self-revealing behavior as verbal, such as disclosing hardships they encountered throughout their life. But self-revealing behavior can also be nonverbal behavior, for example physical touch or sexual contact. Dropping down your defenses and opening up to your partner about private, personal information creates intimacy through communication.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Importance of the Process of Intimacy:</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Thinking back in your relationship when are the times you feel most close to your partner? Some of the instances may be when they supported you after disclosing self-revealing information, such as revealing a concerning diagnosis. Research also supports the importance of promoting intimacy through communication. The intimacy process model that I explained above has been widely researched by experts. It has been shown that closeness and well-being is increased by being in a relationship with an empathetic, responsive partner that expresses feelings of vulnerability.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Evidence also supports that a relationship is damaged when one partner is in a vulnerable state and their partner responds with walking away and becoming disengaged. Imagine how you would feel if you tell your partner one of your insecurities and they don’t respond or give a dismissive answer. It is important to be empathetic and put yourself in the position of your partner, especially when they are expressing feelings of vulnerability. When your response lack empathy, you not only miss the chance to be supportive of your partner; but also, you lose out on an opportunity to enhance the intimacy in the relationship. Also, you may miss out on future possibilities of increasing intimacy through communication, because your partner fears to be vulnerable with you again. If withdrawal in the face of vulnerability keeps occurring throughout the relationship, intimacy in the relationship will really take a hit, even possibly ending the relationship. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Other research studies including one that looked at relationships where one partner had been diagnosed with breast cancer linked increased self-disclosure to predict better partner responsiveness leading to stronger feelings of closeness. Would you believe that having a responsive partner also corresponds to how well patients recover from critical medical diagnose? Empathy and responsiveness really do mean so much to individual and relational well-being and intimacy. In the study, patient’s severe physical pain corresponded to their partner’s gestures of affection and empathy even when all participants had the same general happiness in the relationship.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Role Of Self-Esteem In Intimate Relationships:</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do people with lower self-esteem benefit from disclosing sensitive information? In general, when in a relationship with someone with low self-esteem you have to communicate more clearly in order to properly share your understanding and support, so it gets properly processed through their pessimistic interpretative filter. Interestingly, disclosing vulnerable information does not always have a positive effect. If you struggle with self-esteem research shows that after you disclose you may feel less valued by your partner, while if you chose not to reveal you may feel more valued by your partner. Whereas the opposite is true for people that report high self-esteem, in that they feel more valued by their partner if they reveal and less valued if they do not tell their partner self-revealing information. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Keeping Intimacy in your Relationship:</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Relationships dynamics change throughout time and you may be wondering how to address new challenges in your relationship.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Four Steps to Helping you Enhance Closeness and Intimacy:</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Note</span><span class=\"s2\"><b>: </b></span><span class=\"s1\">Don’t forget about the intimacy process model as it also is important in carrying out these steps.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">1. Participate in Shared Activities</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\">Over time the intimacy and closeness in many relationships declines. This is partly because partners normally get comfortable with the same routine and habits so their relationship lacks new, exciting experiences. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p11\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Self-expansion Model</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> The Self-expansion model explains the common “years of blandness’ following an initial happy relationship. There are two assumptions in the model. The first is no matter the relationship status, people strive to reach their goals by increasing their productivity. To increase their effectiveness they search for resources, learn, and take time in strengthening their skills. The second assumption is that intimate relationships are one common way to enhance your identity and increase capacity to meet your goals. In the first years of a relationship, everything seems new and exciting. You are expanding yourselves together. Your meeting your partner’s family and maybe tasting new cooking recipes. Overtime, you become used to your partner and the exhilaration in the relationship typically fades. Expanding with your partner decreases because expansion has limits. For example, once you stay up all night getting to know your partner’s life philosophy you grow together. But, once you already know your partner, growing together does not come as naturally when you fall into a normal routine. Then the feelings of love and intimacy may fade since self-expansion in the relationship drops.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you bring back growing together into relationships?</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> </b>Create new experiences that unknown qualities and aspects of each partner can come to light. Sharing in activities gives the opportunity to gain deeper levels of understanding, care, and validation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">Questions to ask when picking a Shared Activity</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you consider it exciting?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Does your partner consider the activity exciting?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Does the time and length of the activity work for both of you?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Can you both grow or move onto new stages of this activity together?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Does this activity have me spending time with my partner or is it more independent?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">2. Support each other</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you know the greater social ties and connections you have the more likely you will live a longer and healthier life? Being there for your partner through thick and thin not only helps with emotional wellbeing, but also physical.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>But what does social support look like in relationships?</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Social support can be as simple as being a listening ear when your partner had a tough day at work. Or it can be more serious types of social support. For example, Christopher Reeve the star of the <i>Superman</i> movies, became paralyzed due to falling from a horse. His wife, Dana, was there by his side the whole way and was constantly committed to him. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Benefits of support in relationships</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Partners in more supportive relationships are better able to face challenges and cope with external stress. Overtime, the benefits of a supportive relationship are still felt, because the partners know how to work as a team to resolve conflicts. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">The role of perception in supportive relationships</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How your partner interprets your support has a major effect on outcomes. That’s why there is a difference in how your interpretative filter perceives support available to you and support you actually receive. People prefer and benefit more from support that relationship experts call <b>invisible support</b> which is support we perceive to be available. The opposite is <b>visible support</b> which is the support you know you have received which can be damaging to one’s self-esteem and actually increase pressure. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This may have you a little confused, so imagine if you have a goal to lose weight and your partner is constantly in your face to monitor your workout and count your calories you may be a little annoyed. That is an example of visible support. An example of invisible support would be knowing your partner is there for you to comfort and motivate you if you are not making the weight loss progress desired. Knowing the level of support can help you be at the sweet spot to not overwhelm your partner. Supportive relationships depend on if your partner’s perception of your support enables them to feel capable and competent in the face of hardships.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">3. Make the Most out of Positive Personal Experiences</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sharing with your partner that you got an A+ on your final makes you feel accomplished and in return your partner typically feels proud of you. Leading psychology researchers have found that sharing of positive events in a relationship, builds both personal and interpersonal resources. This process of sharing positive events is referred to as Capitalization. Capitalization allows us to relive those events when we tell our partner about them and lets your partner experience the positive impact of them with you. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There is a catch to capitalization. Like all the other steps, the success of them depend on both you and your partner’s interpretative filter. There are four possible responses to sharing with your partner your success of getting an A+ on your final:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s1\">Which response would you like to receive? </span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Active-constructive response: Wow! That is amazing! I would love to see the paper; I am so proud of you!</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Passive-constructive response: Oh, that’s great, how did your other finals go? </span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Active-destructive response: An A+, I am surprised. It is a lot better than you got last time.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Passive-destructive response: Maybe I should take that class, since it seems easy. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now think back to what response you typically give to your partner.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How your partner responds and how you respond when there is a sharing of positive events has such an impact in the intimacy of your relationship. Research shows that relationships that have the active-constructive response have the highest levels of intimacy, while relationships that rely on the other responses have much lower intimacy levels.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">4. Forgive each other</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Forgiving is the most challenging step in some relationships. Betrayal happens in different forms not just cheating. Many relationships are challenged by a partner breaking a promise, lying, or talking behind the other partner’s back. If you choose to continue the relationship after betrayal, forgiveness is the only option for a healthy, intimate relationship. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Will my partner forgive me?</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whether or not one partner forgives the other depends on four main factors:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Seriousness of the offense</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Personality of the victim</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Qualities of the apology</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Depth of the relationship</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do I forgive?</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Forgiveness comes from when you transform your pain into a generous, unselfish attitude towards your partner. Forgiveness is a process that involves changing your personal motivation and expressing your forgiveness through behavior and communication.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"> Silent Forgiveness</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> This type of forgiveness happens when your personal motivation changes in that you are motivated and emotionally ready to forgive.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"> Hollow Forgiveness</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Hollow forgiveness is when you only express to your partner that you have forgiven them, but you still lack the emotional motivation to really forgive them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To truly forgive your partner you must be ready and motivated to forgive them and communicate that you have forgiven your partner. Forgiveness is an unselfish act that maintains the relationship by focusing on compassion and sincere apologies.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<h2>Relationship Questions</h2>\n<p>Although everyone tries to cook up a unique recipe for love, the formation, course, and quality of every intimate relationship is a reflection of the personality and experiences each person brings to the relationship. In addition to being mostly water, we’re all made of characteristics and memories that shape us. Our personality is often what mostly draws our romantic partner to us and combined with their personality is what causes a concoction of love’s special chemistry. Instead of relying on horoscopes from astrology or other forms of pseudoscience to predict a relationships’ success or failure, personality traits can be studied through a scientific lens and serve as a reliable, valid tool to improve the relationship we have with ourselves and a significant other. Prior to pondering what makes our relationships what they are, we should self-reflect about what makes us who we are and how our personalities and histories influence our approach to interpersonal relationships.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Tendencies of Personality Traits</h2>\n<p>Imagine your ideal partner, what about them do you most love? It’s common for people to hope they will be in a romantic relationship with someone who’s above average in crucial areas. Physical appearance, sure, but more importantly someone who genuinely admires and appreciates our personality. Someone who’s trustworthy, expressive, and has a good sense of humor. We want the universe to unite us with our soulmate. When actually choosing a partner for a long-term relationship, people often prefer an average-looking person with an amazing personality over an extremely attractive person with an average personality. The relatively stable, distinctive qualities which characterize an individual over time and across various scenarios and influence how they’ll behave and adapt to the world are known as their personality. Are there personality traits that seem linked to the success of failure of a relationship? The first attempts at exploring the relationship between a personality and intimacy focused on possible problems a personality might cause and temperament.</p>\n<p>Psychologist Lewis Terman became famous by identifying the factors that distinguish a happily married couple from an unhappy couple. He proposed that most married partners that sooner or later feel they’re incompatible feel that way not because of new information or events but because of predispositions to unhappiness. That because of nature or nurture they lacked qualities that make people compatible and that they were incapable of finding happiness in any marriage. That theory did not prioritize interpersonal communication or scratch the surface of its importance and impact on a relationship! Terman was a trait theorist and believed that in order to understand a relationship, people must inspect the personality of each partner. The Big Five traits which are pretty general and encompassing yet address specific aspects of personality include openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and negative affectivity or neuroticism. Openness measures how receptive someone is to new ideas, approaches, and experiences. Conscientiousness measures how disciplined and organized someone is. Extraversion measures someone’s preference for social interaction and lively activity. Agreeableness measures someone’s selfless concern for others, their generosity, and how trusting they are.</p>\n<h2>Personality, Emotion, and Relationships</h2>\n<p>Most people’s Big Five are consistent throughout their lives. Even measures of personality from someone’s childhood can predict their adult relationships. Children who throw numerous temper tantrums before they turn ten are twice as likely to divorce and women with a history of tantrums tend to marry men of lower occupational status. When an adult’s personality assessment is conducted, it also leads to links between personality traits and experiences in relationships. Virtually every study on personality traits and relationships have found that people with high negative affectivity tend to ruminate on negative qualities they have, others have, and in the world in general. They seem to be vulnerable to poor relationships and have low self-esteem. In a 50-year study of marriage, engaged people that were negative were more likely to become unhappy and divorce. Of those couples, husbands tended to be more outgoing and impulsive than unhappy husbands who remained married. Thus, unhappy spouses are more likely to divorce if husbands have personality traits that make them prone to engage in deconstructive behaviors like infidelity, financial irresponsibility, and excessive drinking. Behaviors reflecting negative affectivity cause distress which when combined with personality traits will either result in divorce or passive suffering in a stable but unsatisfactory marriage.</p>\n<p>The other personality traits have not been studied as much but one can easily expect that couples who are more agreeable or more conscientious are usually happier. People with disagreeable partners report being treated with condescension and disrespected. People with neurotic partners report their relationships suffering because of self-centeredness, jealousy, dependence, and a lot of criticism. You can imagine why being in a relationship with someone who constantly highlights your flaws, rarely gives you the benefit of the doubt when you make a mistake and is often hostile. Last but certainly not least, sex lives tend to be less satisfying for couples where one or both partners suffers from high tension and distress associated with negative affectivity. Keep in mind, similarities in a soul’s age, general intelligence, political views, and religious beliefs predict happiness better than similar personality traits. You don’t need to try to date your clone, your best bet is to connect with someone who is generally more agreeable and positive than someone who is just like you in regard to the Big Five. Personality traits set the boundaries within a relationship and affect how partners communicate, perceive each other’s behavior, and respond during difficult times. The traits that have been found to matter the most are negative affectivity, agreeableness, and conscientiousness because they set the day-to-day emotional tone of our relationships.</p>\n<h2>Negative Affectivity and Low Self-esteem Affect Relationships</h2>\n<p>Recent research on the dependence regulation mode demonstrates that people with low-self-esteem underestimate how favorably their partners view them. This underestimation sets off a domino effect of unintentional sabotage. For example, being excessively defensive, overreacting to criticism, dismissing genuine praise, and feeling and expressing strong negative emotions like anger. The cycle starts with personal experience of self-esteem, then someone underestimates positive feelings towards them and the relationship, they then devalue their partner and feel hurt and neglected which leads to expressing their discontent, and then they and their partner are pessimistic and dissatisfied with the relationship which reinforces this deadly cycle. The point is, when someone has chronic low self-esteem, the relationship really suffers. They assume their partners don’t think highly of them and that others share the pessimistic perception they have of themselves. Studies show they are wrong! Insecure people struggle with the difficult decision of whether to express concerns and risk becoming even more vulnerable or to be overly cautious and self-protective in the relationship. In an effort to protect a fragile personal identity, people with low self-esteem try to reduce the risk of rejection but as a result build a wall between themselves and their partners which increases their insecure feelings of the relationship.</p>\n<p>Unjustified doubts sew deadly seeds that can weaken a relationship. They lead to a form of self-sabotage where insecure people perceive their partner is unfavorable and they express discontent when all their heart wishes is to be closer and receive for confirmation, they are special and loved. When someone with a personality trait of low self-esteem believes their partner doesn’t truly love them, they look for evidence they do, yet detect rejection even when it doesn’t exist and devalue their partner. Perhaps they devalue their partner as a defensive strategy to believe they’ll have less to lose if the relationship ends. Contrastingly, confident people with high self-esteem are less sensitive to threats to the relationship and don’t exaggerate problems or place a relationship under scrutiny like someone with insecure feelings would. The personality trait of low self-esteem leaves people prone to feeling hurt and ignored and more likely to express anger and sadness, especially after disagreements. This adds more fuel to the fire by worsening arguments, promotes emotional distancing, and prevents partners from apologizing, reconnecting, and healing the relationship. Interestingly, there are people with low self-esteems that have satisfying relationships and confident people that don’t. Nevertheless, the dependence regulation model specifies key psychological processes which lead to relationship dissatisfaction.</p>\n<h2>Childhood Experiences Affect Adult Relationships</h2>\n<p>Personality traits provide valid information about the intimate relationships people will have and whether they’ll last or end. Keep in mind, not even the best personality tests can fully capture the complexity of anyone’s character or how they’ll behave in a relationship. Most of us can recognize intergenerational transmission effects; that who we are as individuals and as romantic partners was shaped by how we were raised, and relationship scientists have learned that each new generation in a family partially resembles previous generations. Experiences are transmitted from one generation of parents on to the next generation, their children, and the cycle repeats. Some of the most significant effects arise when families dissolve in say, a divorce, and then reappear in another form. We learn a lot about our partners by meeting the families they were raised in, their families of origin. For example, your partner may get their goofy sense of humor from a parent or love public displays of affection because they have parents that can’t keep their hands off of each other.</p>\n<p>The divorce rate has slightly declined since the 1980s but about half of all first marriages and an even higher amount of second marriages end in permanent separation or divorce. Not all divorces involve children, but more than one million children experience the divorce of their parents every year in the United States. About 40 percent of all children experience their parents divorcing before they become young adults. Experiences vary dramatically for different families and children in the same family can vary in their response to their parent’s separation or divorce. Five key conclusions have emerged from research on how parental conflict and relationship dissolutions affect individuals as they develop from children to adolescents, to adults.</p>\n<p>1. Parental separation or divorce often negatively affects a child’s academic achievement, conduct and behavior, psychological adjustment, self-esteem, and social relationships.</p>\n<p>2. Parental divorce approximately doubles the risk of negative consequences for children but children with parents who have an intact marriage can also experience them.</p>\n<p>3. Divorce jeopardizes a family’s economic circumstances, compromises the parents’ mental health, reduces the quantity and quality of parent-child contact, and leaves everyone involved vulnerable to new types of distress.</p>\n<p>Despite the best intentions, the quality of parenting often suffers because of a divorce, and family instability decreases the chances a child will receive the emotional support and guidance they need. Fortunately, the use of active coping skills can offset adverse effects.</p>\n<p>4. Raising children in emotionally distressed homes, even with biological parents together can negatively affect children, especially when parental conflicts aren’t properly resolved. Children exposed to higher levels of parental conflict have lower self-esteem, happiness, and life satisfaction in early adulthood compared to children exposed to lower levels of parental conflict.</p>\n<p>5. The psychological health of adult children depends on a complex combination of whether their parents divorced and the marriage’s health prior to the divorce. A study of 27-year-olds found children’s well-being is the lowest when marriages with little conflict end and when marriages with a lot of conflict do not end. Unexpected divorces decrease a child’s capacity to develop long-term trusting relationships.</p>\n<p>A complete understanding of an intimate relationships doesn’t begin when two people meet. It begins when parents meet and create a new family. Children with rocky family foundations are more cautious toward relationships and more accepting of divorce. Children of divorce may marry earlier than children not exposed to parental divorce, perhaps reflecting a desire to leave difficult family situations. They are also more likely to cohabit without marrying and delay getting married. They’re just as motivated to form intimate relationships as children from intact families but tend to be more pessimistic about marriage as the way to accomplish that goal. Children from unstable and troubled families tend to have less money and fewer friends as they complete adolescence and begin adulthood. Children of divorced parents are less likely to graduate from high school or start college. They’re also at a greater risk of unplanned pregnancies and dissatisfying relationships with their parents even later in life. Father-child relationships are particularly fragile following family breakups. Children from unstable families experience more relationship distress and dissolution themselves. Experiences they have can be linked to what happened in their parents’ relationship. Regardless of the parents’ education, income, religious views, and whether or not they divorced children whose parents were unhappy in marriage are likely to form relatively unhappy marriages.</p>\n<h2>The Social Learning Theory</h2>\n<p>Children learn about relationships from watching how family members relate to one another, their relationships with their parents, siblings, other family members, and internalize emotional and behavioral models to generalize relationships outside the family. The interpersonal styles they learn influence their adolescent and adult intimate relationships. Children exposed to various forms of abuse and neglect in childhood carry those experiences with them and based on those experiences, the quality of newlywed marriages can be predicted, including increased psychological aggression and relationship problems, and decreased trust and sexual activity. Even couples in the dating stage of a relationship with a partner from a harsh and conflicted family will have less positive behavior in communication because the person from the troubled family will have less self-control over emotions and a greater tendency to have hostile and cynical attitudes toward other people in general. Married couples discussing relationship problems, one partner being from a troubled home, will suffer because that person with a history of parental divorce will likely disagree, express disrespect and disdain for their partner, and withdraw in unproductive ways. The presence of a supportive spouse does not offset this effect, their marriages are predicted to be less fulfilling. Fortunately, children who grow up in warm, nurturing families feel more closely connected to their intimate partner 60 years later. They are able to do this by being less defensive, more realistic about life challenges, and by being more emotionally engaged with those challenges while managing them. Without a doubt, we are shaped by the ways our parents managed their emotions and conversations while we were kids but the effects of family upbringing on adult relationships vary. Many people who grow up with conflicted or divorced parents are able to create and maintain satisfying intimate relationships.</p>\n<h2>The Attachment Theory</h2>\n<p>Our attachment behavior system, an innate set of behaviors and reactions shaped by evolution, helps ensure our safety and survival and governs our capacity to form emotional bonds. For example, when your partner doesn’t respond to your cues when you want to cuddle or doesn’t say supportive things when you need a pep talk, how do you take it? Just like politicians, people in intimate relationships can spin events in constructive or deconstructive ways. Maybe they didn’t cuddle you or give you a pep talk because they knew you were strong enough to handle it yourself and had faith you could handle a situation independently. Maybe they didn’t cuddle you or give you a pep talk because the other day you didn’t wash the plates and take out the trash even though it was your turn and they’re trying to get back at you. Our internal working models affect how we interpret interpersonal events like these. People with a secure attachment style tend to minimize the impact of negative events while people with insecure attachments tend to magnify the impact of the same events. People with the most negative working models of themselves and others, fearful individuals, typically have the most pessimistic interpretations of relationship events. People who try to repress their emotions express less emotion in response to relationship events and report being less aware of physical manifestations of anger like tension and a faster heart rate. People with an anxious attachment will compensate for low self-esteem by overusing available support and might not even be satisfied by it. People prone to avoidance will adopt a defensive position and deny their need for support, they’ll use distancing strategies to cope with their distress.</p>\n<p>People with a secure attachment style approach relationship problems with more warmth, more compassion, and less hostility. They are also inclined to have open conversations with their partner when they are upset and less likely to think about breaking up. Secure partners are likely to clearly communicate needs, expect their partner will help address their needs, and gratefully accept their partners’ efforts to help. Fearful individuals do the opposite by stonewalling and closing off contact and are inclined to jump to conclusions about ending the relationship. Attachment theory provides essential clues about kinds of communication that nourish or harm relationships. The attachment behavior system isn’t always operating though, it’s activated when a person is challenged or access to their caregiver is threatened. For example, at the airport security checkpoint where only passengers can go through security, many people can be seen trying to hug and kiss goodbye until the very last minute and promising to reconnect as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>How to Overcome Insecurity</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Self-affirmations</strong></p>\n<p>Identify values that are important to you (e.g. honestly, community service, spirituality, working hard) and write about why they’re important to you, how they shape your life and play a key role in your self-image</p>\n<p><strong>2. Adopt Your Partner’s Perspective</strong></p>\n<p>Imagine what a day in your partner’s shoes is like. Describe in detail what their five senses pick up on during a typical day. What do they see, smell, taste, touch, and hear?</p>\n<p><strong>3. Elaborate on a Compliment</strong></p>\n<p>Think about a time your partner said how much they liked something about you such as a personal quality or ability, or something you did that really impressed them. Explain in detail why they admire you, what that means to you and its significance for your relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Increase Psychological and Physical Closeness</strong></p>\n<p>Work with your partner through a series of increasingly personal questions and discuss your responses together (e.g. if you were to die tonight with no opportunity to text or call anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone? Why haven’t you told them yet?) After answering deep questions and connecting over them, engage in 30 minutes of gentle stretching and yoga together (or another similar activity that fits your physical abilities and preferences such as a walk in nature).</p>\n<p><strong>5. Remember</strong></p>\n<p>Remember that simple activities can weaken the influence of insecure attachments on relationships and implement tools regularly in your daily life. Remember that regardless of how secure or insecure we feel, we all have room to improve our relationships and there are a plethora of resources at your fingertips. Be willing to research and practice them, an investment in a relationship will never be a waste!</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<h2>Matchmaker</h2>\n<p>During and after biblical times, people have sought out help with finding partners they are compatible with to build satisfying relationships. Some of the most common google searches are all centered on relationships and how to become and find a perfect 10. Matchmaking websites promise clients to use science and technology to find them compatible partners. Dating coaches promise clients to combine personal experience and intuition to find them compatible partners and coach them to be successful in their relationships. Despite technological advances, matchmaking is a market showing no signs of slowing down and continues to grow.</p>\n<p>Every single day, people pass, babies are born, hearts are broken, and people fall in love. How does this love thing take two people that were completely independent, possibly strangers, and transform them into inseparable love birds who either completely mesh in a relationship and work to spend their lives happily together or break each other’s hearts leaving each other with the task to heal and start their search for a compatible soulmate again? Let’s dive into the process of creating an intimate relationship.</p>\n<h2>Physical Appearance</h2>\n<p>We are told not to judge a book by its cover and try to do the same when looking for compatible partners but let’s be honest. The first thing we naturally notice about a person is their physical appearance. It’s not the only thing that sparks romantic interest, but it is a factor that will either make your heart beat faster and result in the dilation of your pupils or turn you off. Take a moment to self-reflect. What makes you leap from liking someone to really liking someone and wanting to be more than friends with them? The experience of desiring someone as an intimate partner, romantic attraction with or without a sexual element, is the universal experience known as the mystery of romantic attraction.</p>\n<p>When we first physically walk into a room, or log into a platform, we can’t immediately know someone’s morals, work ethic, intelligence, or sense of humor but we quickly and easily realize whether we are into someone’s physical appearance or not. Interestingly, studies have shown that college freshman will decide whether or not to go on a second date with someone based on solely physical appearance with variables like shared interests, backgrounds, and grades not seeming to matter. When college students and married couples are asked to name the attributes, they find most appealing in a potential partner, men and women rated attributes similarly except for physical attraction. Men reported valuing physical appearance more than women did. This difference was found across cultures, ethnicities, and age groups. However, this doesn’t necessarily indicate that appearance influences men more than women. Just because women don’t report caring about appearances as much as men do doesn’t mean they actually value personality over appearance or earning potential over appearance. Many women think they are more influenced by earning potential or emotional expressiveness but show they prioritize appearance when rating potential partners.  A meta-analysis of about 100 studies confirmed that perceiving a partner as physically attractive equally predicts greater romantic attraction for both the female and male gender. The difference that was confirmed between men and women was that women are more harsh when judging a man’s attractiveness and are more likely to message men that they don’t find highly attractive while men judge more equal numbers of women as highly attractive or not so attractive but are more likely to initiate conversation with the top of the women they find are the best looking. Statistics from OkCupid show the most attractive men are 11 times more likely than the least attractive men to be direct messaged while the most attractive women are 25 times more likely to receive direct messages than the least attractive women on the site.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Reality Check</h2>\n<p>If everyone wanted the best-looking people, then how would the rest of us find compatible partners we would like to start relationships with? We don’t always pursue the most physically perfect people we can find. In fact, research confirms a matching phenomenon; a tendency for people who are in a relationship or about to get married to usually be similar to each other in physical appearance. Research also explores a possible explanation for why we may or may not pursue the most visually aesthetic partner we see, how we look ourselves!</p>\n<p>Hot, attractive individuals receive more attention from everyone. Attractive people who are used to admiration tend to be more comfortable with approaching other good-looking people and are less likely to ask out people far less attractive than them. Inversely, people who are less hot might understandably fear rejection more and be more apprehensive about approaching potential partners, less likely to ask out someone who’s out of their league therefore going after a compatible person who is also less than gorgeous. The matchmaking phenomenon is supported because in real life, the desire to avoid rejection and make a connection leads people to date others similar in physical attraction. It’s not that some people care less about physical attractiveness but the role that physical attraction plays in someone’s life seeking a relationship is different than the role beauty plays in someone’s life simply seeking a one-night stand.</p>\n<h2>Why Appearance Makes Such a Difference</h2>\n<p>The role physical appearance plays in the start of a brewing romance is large, but it’s not the protagonist in a satisfying relationship. Then again, when we don’t know much about a person, we tend to correlate high physical appeal with other positive qualities. This assumption is so relevant is has been found to affect employment, favoring highly attractive individuals when their physical characteristics are on display. For example, two people with the exact same education and experience with a different level of physical attractiveness will not have the same experience during a job interview. Good looking people have a greater chance of being hired after a job interview and usually have a higher salary in their first jobs. They’re also less likely to be convicted of crimes and when they are, their sentences are usually shorter. In a study asking participants to judge strangers based on a photo, the faces that were rated as being more attractive were also assumed to be people who were more interesting, kind, and successful than the people with less attractive faces. Although other than the golden ratio based on a face’s symmetry, physical attractiveness somewhat varies across cultures, there is a universal finding that attractive people enjoy certain advantages.</p>\n<p>Concrete advantages that hotter people enjoy include but aren’t limited to social advantages like receiving more smiles and having people report feeling more positive when interacting with them. Particularly, handsome men have more conversations with women than less attractive men. Attractive women get more dates and have more sex than less attractive women. The assumption that attractive people are more sociable leads men to engage in interactions which encourage their partners to fulfill that expectation. When men believe the women they are talking to are more attractive they are more animated and friendly. When women are believed to be very attractive, they are more social and friendly. Physical appearance has a powerful influence on social interactions for both genders.</p>\n<p>Negative consequences of being attractive include but are not limited to being unfairly judged as vain and promiscuous. Also, people tend to lie about themselves when talking to better looking people so often times attractive people find it hard to trust positive feedback they receive. Evolution tries to explain the high regard for physical attractiveness with the theory that what is now attractive was once an essential indicator of good health in a compatible mate. Ironically, we now know that physical appearance does not necessarily indicate health. Being handsome or beautiful doesn’t mean someone will be fit and healthy.</p>\n<h2>Personal Characteristics</h2>\n<p>While how compatible a partner may be is not prioritized over how hot they are for a sexy fling, long-term relationships prioritize characteristics like personality and intelligence as much as attractiveness. Qualities which people can be hierarchically ranked on are called vertical attributes. For example, physical attractiveness, health, and income level are vertical attributes as having more of them is seen to be better than having less. Vertical attributes are commonly valued, especially in relationships which is why seeking compatible partners based on them will lead to rigorous competition. Contrastingly, a horizontal attribute is a quality people can differ on without being judged as better or worse than others such as food preferences, hobbies, political beliefs and career choices. Imagine being a shrimp fanatic on a date with someone who hates raw fish but loves steak tacos. One preference is not better than the other, but you might feel as compatible as you would if you shared a love for shrimp. When people describe their ideal mate, they usually describe vertical and horizontal attributes “I want someone gorgeous and wealthy who loves dogs and intellectually stimulating movies.”</p>\n<h2>Personality and Similarity</h2>\n<p>Personality is a vertical attribute, and research shows everyone wants a compatible partner that has positive traits. Universally an attractive personality is genuine, honest, loyal, intelligent, dependable, open-minded and thoughtful and an unattractive personality isn’t. It was found that being fun is not admired as much as being honest is; we are more attracted to good people than we are to fun people. Although we end up in relationships with people whose personalities resemble ours, similarity in personality plays a small role in relationship satisfaction. It’s easy to understand that happy, well-adjusted people are more attracted to other happy, well-adjusted people but there is no reason to expect depressed, neurotic people are more attracted to other depressed, neurotic people. Relationships where two people are similar in unattractive traits are less successful than relationships with people who aren’t as similar in unattractive traits. It seems complementary personalities, not similar personalities, are more likely to predict romantic attraction. However, the idea that we are attracted to people with qualities we lack, has not been supported. Introverts are not necessarily magnetized to extroverts. In general, people don’t report being more attracted to people who have qualities they don’t. Where did the belief that opposites attract come from?</p>\n<p>Perhaps happy relationships lead people to behave in compatible ways to complement each other even if they are already more similar to each other than to other people.</p>\n<p>Although complementary traits may affect how compatible people interact in public, the foundation of their attraction is mostly their similar characteristics and tendencies. We seem to value horizontal attributes like background and interests over vertical ones like personality. Consistent evidence shows a strong pattern, partners tend to date, cohabit, and marry people similar in race, education, and religion. Partners also tend to share values, attitudes and interests. Similarity in preferences and attitudes is appealing because it results in validation. When people are into what we’re into, it justifies our interests and makes us feel better about ourselves. It also makes it easier to get along, when two people enjoy the same TV shows and foods, there’s less to argue about. This is why online matchmaking sites like eHarmony, OKCupid, and Match.com emphasize similar horizontal attributes in potentially compatible partners. Interestingly, married couples with similar backgrounds are less likely to divorce but similar attitudes and interests don’t greatly predict relationship satisfaction. The findings that husbands are happier when they share values and opinions about spending free time with their wives aren’t supported enough and thus can’t be seen as a strong basis for romantic attraction. There’s are unlimited ways to find similarities between people and identifying people similar to us doesn’t narrow the amount of fish in the sea. When we’re into someone, we’ll find a bunch of preferences and traits we have in common. When there’s no spark, we won’t and will instead find endless causes of conflict. People who like each other usually perceive they have a lot in common regardless of how alike they actually are. Perception is key and perception of similarity indicates success for a relationship but even more so is a result of feeling good about a relationship.</p>\n<h2>Reciprocity and Selectivity</h2>\n<p>We naturally wonder whether someone is attracted to us while deciding whether or not we’re attracted to them. If they have the good taste to appreciate us, they’re probably cool, right? Study after study proves the finding that knowing we are liked by someone has a powerful influence on our attraction to that person even more than knowing about their traits and values. For example, one study put strangers to work in pairs to test this. One member of each pair was actually a member of the research team and was trained to treat all the actual participants the same way. After interacting for a while, each pair individually filled out a questionnaire about their experiences. While the actual participants were alone, waiting to receive their materials they could hear their partner revealing what he or she thought of them. The feedback was manipulated to be either completely positive or critical for the actual participants. The actual behavior of the research partner was always the same but when the actual participant heard their partner being positive with their report about them, they tended to like them much more than when their partner was critical of them.</p>\n<p>However, we don’t always like people more based on how much they like us. Another study proved not all liking is equally rewarding and our attraction to someone is influenced by how their opinion of us develops over time. Similar to the first study, participants worked in pairs but this time in a series of seven exercises throughout an experimental session. This time when participants overheard their partner talking about them there were four possible conditions. In the first, there was nothing but positive feedback. The partner seemed to like them from the beginning of the study and continued to until the end. In the second, there was nothing but negative feedback. The partner seemed to dislike the participant at first and continued to until the end. In the third condition, the partner expressed positive feelings in the beginning of the interaction but then expressed far less positive feelings over time until they expressed a negative opinion in the end. The fourth was the opposite, the partner began feeling negative but by the end of the 7 exercises they expressed opinions as positive as the positive feelings in the first condition. This study found the relationship between our attraction and how much someone likes us is stronger when they initially dislike us and grow to like us. If we truly find people more attractive the more they like us then the first condition with a partner that really liked the participant throughout all 7 exercises would have been the most liked, not the second. Dating works the same way, our attraction to someone can depend on how selective they are. Someone who would date anyone is not as attractive as someone who is picky but eager to go out with you again. Approval is most rewarding when we have a reason to take it personally. An eager person on a first date who immediately likes us might not be as attractive as someone who is harder to please. Kind words from someone who is kind to everyone aren’t taken very seriously as they are less likely to be personal. Someone who grows to like us more over time, or only likes is may be harder to please but when they do express liking us, we feel sure their approval is based on our personal qualities, and we love that.</p>\n<h2>Unrequited Love</h2>\n<p>Consistent with social exchange theory, we usually pursue relationships that will benefit us more than they will cost us. However, this leaves out the category of unrequited, one-way attraction. We can be extremely attracted to people who are not attracted to us at all. If we were more attracted to people who show high interest in us then theoretically our feelings for someone who clearly is not into us should fade once we’re sure they have no intention of reciprocating our feelings and desires. Unfortunately, unrequited feelings can persist even though they cause anguish and heartache. Sometimes people are even drawn to those who reject, ignore, or even abuse them. In one study on college students more than 80 percent of participants reported experiencing unrequited love. There were three identified rewards for unrequited love. The students believed their crush was exceptionally desirable, they believed their current unrequited feelings would probably become mutual eventually, and simply being in love was found to be rewarding, even if it was one-sided. The students believed if they worked hard and long enough that their faithful investment in love would be returned with interest. Modern rom-coms often portray initially rejected characters as eventually earning their happily ever after by the end of the story. With this in mind, it’s not unreasonable for someone to stay in unrequited love with someone. The appeal for winning someone over in the future regardless of initial rejection may help explain stalking. Stalking is unwanted and possibly disturbing attention from someone who wants to start or continue a romantic relationship. What increases how dangerous stalkers can be is their insistence that they’ll eventually win their targets over despite all clear evidence that there’s no mutual interest. Outside of an experimental interaction it may be difficult to communicate that initial negative feelings about someone will remain negative, no matter what.</p>\n<p>When people were interviewed about being loved by someone they did not love, any benefits were mostly outweighed by the cost of having to reject someone. People wanted to clearly communicate feelings weren’t mutual but feared hurting someone’s feelings and then feeling guilty. This led to a bunch of “it’s not you, it’s me” phrases. Unfortunately, unclear messages can result in misinterpretations that a reluctance to break a heart means some sort of reciprocated attraction and interest in a relationship. Playing hard to get is only attractive when combined with a possibility for a love game to be won, successfully resulting in a relationship. People who successfully play hard to get clearly communicate no current interest, but they could be won over with a little effort. Unrequited love offers rewards that are not exempted from the reward theory of attraction, but they are more hypothetical than real.</p>\n<h2>Knowing What You Want in a Compatible Romantic Partner</h2>\n<p>There’s a common assumption that people will end up in a relationship with someone who mostly fits the description of what they say they are looking for in a romantic partner. If Connor says he is looking for a redhead who loves to read, we’d expect that Connor’s new girlfriend is compatible with him, is a redhead, and loves to read. However, studies have found no correlation between how people rate the importance of physical appearance, earning potential, and friendliness and someone they want a second date with after speed dating them.</p>\n<p>People in happy relationships often describe having a perfect fit, implying having a partner who matches the qualities they desire in a mate. However, although results from personality scales and questionnaires about values and standards for relationships could predict who is most desirable, they didn’t predict whether two people would like each other or not. What people say they want in a partner may predict who they will respond to on a dating profile but does not indicate much about they’ll respond to when meeting someone in person. In person we quickly learn how someone makes us feel, how responsive they are to our jokes, and how our hearts beat when they’re around. Romanic attraction, often referred to as chemistry, one might feel with another person is not like online shopping. Clothes don’t have to choose you back but for a relationship, both people must decide they are compatible and choose each other.</p>\n<h2>How Context Affects Romantic Attraction</h2>\n<p>Many people claim to have a “type” when it comes to compatible partners they’re attracted to. Our preferences for partners can change depending on where we are when we meet someone who we’re interested in. The misattribution of arousal occurs when we are aroused by something but mistakenly assume our arousal is caused by a potential mate and not our environment. This helps explain why an amusement park makes for a great date. At the end of an exciting roller coaster ride, the first thing you see is your hot date! Sexual arousal inspired by an environment can be misinterpreted as romantic attraction. Research has even explored beer goggles, the idea that as time goes by and people get more drunk, the options in a bar appear more attractive. It was found that beer goggles make women appear significantly more attractive to men while it only increases women’s attraction to men half as much. There are also other factors that affect how attracted we are to someone. Sexual strategies theory predicts that our willingness to change our standards on how likely we are to hook up with someone are not the same if we are at a bar, library, or gym. A bar promotes hook ups so if that’s your goal, a bar or loud party could lead to relaxed standards and a wide variety of potential hookups. A library might remind you of different standards, even for a hookup. If however, hook ups are a stepping stone to a long term relationship for you then a bar may lead to higher standards and a narrower range of people you’re attracted to. A library could lead to relaxed standards as it may lead to finding partners willing to deepen a hookup into a long-term relationship. This was tested with men and women by asking them to imagine themselves in various places ranging from a bar, a fraternity party, a café, a classroom, a library, and a church while describing their minimum criteria for choosing who to have a one-night stand with. Men reported lower standards for places that promote hookups like bars and parties and higher standards for places that don’t promote them like churches. Opposingly, women reported the opposite, higher standards for parties and lower standards for churches. To ensure the results were consistent, people actually at these locations were asked to describe their standards for a hookup and the same results were found. Although people may think their type is unchanging, it can really vary depending on the scenario.</p>\n<h2>Making a Connection</h2>\n<p>Mate selection is the process through which a committed relationship is formed. In Western cultures, it’s expected that the mates we select to start a relationship with are people we are initially attracted to. Most people are attracted to more people than they’ll ever intimately connect with. Attraction sets the stage for a relationship but how does a true connection form and how does it result in mutual mate selection? 50 college students who’d fallen in love in the past 6 months were interviewed and the following was found. The first element was noticing the person and their desirable qualities. Then, the most mentioned part of the process, the other person indicated the attraction could be mutual. Basically, people are just waiting for an attractive person to indicate interest in them, someone has to make the first move. Mate selection beings with three behaviors, alerting one’s presence to a potentially compatible partner, establishing one’s gender, and expressing availability and interest in a relationship. The next type of indicator could be behavioral synchrony where people unconsciously mimic each other’s behaviors. Many observable nonverbal indicators work because if one is rejected, they are subtle enough to save one from complete embarrassment. They can lead to misunderstandings, where two people interpret the same signals differently. Men are more likely to rate expressions as indicators of romantic attraction which women would not. Nonverbals can lead to hurt feelings or worse.</p>\n<h2>Self-Disclosure in a Relationship</h2>\n<p>Social penetration theory says the development of a relationship is associated with the variety and deepness of information shared and its personal significance. We tend to like people who share personal details with us and vice versa, which gradually increases intimacy. The rate of self-disclosure changes throughout a relationship. At first there’s reciprocity and when one person shares personal information, the other one immediately does the same. At first. Self-disclosure is a tool for people to learn about each other but later in an established relationship, it’s a way of getting validation and support. Not all self-disclosure is viewed positively like when a person overshares too soon or will talk about themselves to anyone who will listen. The tendency for a relationship to follow the cycle of deciding to match and then broaden self-disclosure is what propels it forward.</p>\n<h2>Developing Commitment in a Relationship</h2>\n<p>There isn’t a universal sequence every relationship follows but there are turning points that indicate people are compatible and want to deepen a relationship. The beginning of a relationship’s characteristics are usually indirect while the further development is indicated by direct and explicit characteristics like an open conversation about feelings and intentions possibly with an exchange of an “I love you.” In established relationships, other indicators for increased commitment include decisions to move in together or accepting jobs allowing both partners to be near each other. The way couples react to external factors like when they’ll graduate from school or professional opportunities help explain the difference between relationships that increase commitment and those that don’t.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Sexual orientation, much like an individual’s sex, is biology-based. Our sexual orientation serves as a map that guides us when we search for intimacy. Same-gender and different-gender relationships are composed of the same basic emotional needs but the approaches same-gender couples take to fulfill those needs are remarkably unique. When attempting to understand the similarities and differences between same-gender and different-gender relationships we must keep in mind that the legal and social context of same-gender relationships is not what it once was and is continuing to change. Also, we can’t assume that a specific couple will be equally representative of any larger group. Last but not least, we have to avoid thinking that heterosexuality is what is normal and anything other than being heterosexual or in a different-gender relationship is not normal. We want to understand same-gender relationships for the sake of understanding various ways people can find and enjoy intimacy, not to measure them up to different-gender relationships as if same-gender relationships are less ideal.</p>\n<h2>Stigma and Prejudice</h2>\n<p>People with same-gender orientations are part of a minority. Like racial, ethnic, and religious minority groups they experience stigmas and prejudice. Unfortunately, same-gender individuals experience discrimination in public places like schools or workplaces but they also experience discrimination and mistreatment from their own families. They experience dramatically higher rates of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and suicidality. Similar to other minorities, even if all legal actions necessary to deem same-gender relationships accepted and stigmas decreased, same-gender relationships would continue to experience prejudice and animosity. For example, the mistreatment they experience ranges from subtle hostility like being laughed at, to not having their romantic partner welcome at family functions, being rejected from jobs because of social media including a same-gender partner, to feeling unsafe making public displays of affection. Same-gender individuals often find themselves preoccupied with worries that people will feel uncomfortable with and object to their relationship. They are often afraid that people will object to who they are because of their sexual orientation. This often leads to internalized homonegativity, a same-gender person’s negative social attitudes toward themselves. When the involuntary tendency to accept and even endorse harsh stereotypes about sexual minorities is developed, mental health is negatively affected. This results in weakened self-esteem, consequently weakening the quality of relationships which decreases the likelihood of a satisfying long-term commitment with an intimate partner. It can even make someone judgmental towards their intimate partner. Then, because they desire someone with a characteristic they reject and suppress in themselves internal conflict arises and complicates everything even more. Experiencing too much discrimination can sometimes decrease how well intimacy is enjoyed in a relationship.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Resilience</h2>\n<p>Interestingly, same-gender couples strengthen their relationships through the misfortune they overcome together, reducing the negative effects a challenge could have on them. Another way same-gender couples remain resilient is by joining supportive communities and building families of choice. Same-gender couples are likely to remain friends and continue to socialize even after the end of their relationships. This is not as common among heterosexuals who usually do not truly maintain friendships with exes after they breakup.</p>\n<h2>Communication, Cooperation, and Conflict</h2>\n<p>We have all heard that communication is key. Which is true! Communication is key in conflict management. This is especially true for same-gender couples. Most same-gender couples combat more stress, discrimination, and prejudice than the average different-gender couple. On the other hand, same-gender couples have the advantage of not having gender differences, which commonly lead to the dismantling of different-gender relationships by causing power imbalances often leaving women at a disadvantage where they may find themselves in a subservient position to men. Different-gender relationships that are committed are very similar to same-gender relationships that are committed in that both types of intimate partnerships prioritize the same traits in potential romantic partners including but not limited to loyalty, authenticity, integrity, kindness, intelligence, and humor. In addition to a similar experience with intimacy, they also argue about similar topics and make similar investments of resources into parenting. However, same-gender couples don’t need to assert their gender and as a result, they divide labor such as household chores much more equally and fairly than different-gender couples do. Instead of dividing tasks based on which gender they are commonly linked to, they promote equality and practicality by dividing tasks based on personal preference instead.</p>\n<p>Then again, if the individuals in a same-gender relationship have different work schedules or do not equally contribute to the relationship financially then they will divide their labor differently, similar to different-gender habits. However, the partner in the same-gender couple that is making a bigger contribution will probably not see their situation as unfair because they won’t link it to being in a subservient role in the relationship like someone might if they were in a different-gender relationship. They don’t assume who will do what based on gender, they actively negotiate because both partners have the same gender. The outcome of having power dynamics diminished to promote equality is that the quality of conversations increases. Same-gender relationships tend to be more equal than different-gender relationships. As a result, they tend to manage difficult conversations about conflict and challenges by using affection and humor while on the other hand, different-gender couples tend to be more aggressive, hostile, intimidating, and complain more. The status hierarchy in different-gender relationships leaves women hostile as they usually have less power than men both in and out of the context of an intimate relationship.</p>\n<h2>Sexual Activity and Sexual Exclusivity</h2>\n<p>No matter the sexual orientation or gender, the more fulfilling the sex life of a couple is, the happier the people that make up the couple will be. Studies find that lesbian couples are either not as motivated as other types of couples to have sex, have trouble initiating, or are too socialized to prioritize the other’s emotions than personal needs which leads to sexual passion sharply declining over time because of how sexual needs are repressed. Studies have not however really studied the quality of sex lesbians have been having, only the frequency that they have sex, which leaves out the unique ways that lesbians show affection. Studies have found that lesbian sexual interactions last 45-60 minutes or more to allow time for various sexual behaviors while male and female interactions typically last 15-30 minutes or less. This explains why although lesbians appear to have sex less frequently, the quality of the sex they have is higher and which is why they are more likely to experience orgasm.</p>\n<p>Another way same-gender couples are distinct is that gay men are more likely to have sexually open relationships. In a study done in 2000 60% of gay men reported having sex outside of their relationships even after making their commitments to their romantic partners official and in 45% of those partnerships studied, both partners said that having sex with someone other than their partner was ok under some circumstances. Comparable figures for married heterosexual men were 15% and 3.5%. In a study conducted in 2009 gay men said that having an agreement about whether or not to be sexually monogamous was universal and from those men, half reported being in monogamous relationships and the other half said they were in open relationships. It was found that two-thirds of the time, agreements to either be monogamous or open were kept and when partners broke an agreement, they told their partner about half the time. A 2012 report found half of gay men in their 30s in relationships lasting about 6 years were monogamous. 30% agreed to have some type of open relationship and the other 20% disagreed over how monogamous or open they actually were in their relationships. Gay men do not necessarily avoid monogamous relationships or find them to be difficult. They separate their stable, supportive, affectionate connections with their romantic partners from sexual interactions with someone other than their primary partner. 40% of gay couples aspire to maintain committed relationships while still pursuing outside sexual partners, which is far higher than the number of lesbian or male and female couples willing to explore that and maintain that. Across many interviews, gay men emphasize how they separate sex from intimate lovemaking in their relationships and how they balance their needs for stable relationships against lust for outside sexual encounters. The themes found in these interviews were mutual need for trust, appreciation from partners for individual feelings of jealousy, valuing clear guidelines set for sexual behaviors with outsiders, and honest discussion for when guidelines agreed upon are violated. The themes also addressed issues of power and control needing to be acknowledged because partners with fewer outside options or a stronger desire for sexual exclusivity can face difficulty when they agree to be in an open relationship. Some couples ask for full disclosure when outside sexual encounters occur. Other couples prefer to follow a strict “don’t ask don’t tell” policy, and some people maintain an open relationship in silence, never discussing it at all. Gay men in open relationships might have certain privileges monogamous relationships don’t offer but they also have a unique set of challenges because emotion is just as much of a natural male trait as sexual desire is.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Through a heteronormative lens, Jim Obergefell and John Arthur are the gay couple who changed the history of marriage in the United States. Ironically, Jim Obergefell does not see it that way. He simply sees himself as having been blessed enough to fall and stay in love for a long time. Many people in same-gender relationships have the fact that they are gay labeled as their most distinguishing feature but do not see it as such. However, facing stigma, prejudice, and being discriminated against so frequently creates demands on same-gender couples like internalized homonegativity which often leaves couples disagreeing on how “out” to be. Same-gender couples rely heavily on their families of choice and communities they find for the support they need and might not find as easily as different-gender relationships. People in same-gender and different-gender relationships share the same basic needs. What differentiates them is that the approaches same-gender couples take to fulfill those needs are special and unique. Same-gender couples, both gay and lesbian, emphasize equality and fairness more than a different-gender couple of a man and a woman does which allows them to cooperate and manage conflict with increased sensitivity to each partner’s needs and emotions. There is also an undeniable difference between same-gender relationships and different-gender relationships when it comes to sexual behavior. Lesbian sex tends to occur less frequently than heterosexual sex, but on average, lesbian sex lasts much longer and has been found to have a higher probability of leading to orgasm for women. Gay men report having a higher desire for sex than lesbians and heterosexuals. There is definitely something special about the way same-gender couples are intimate, manage conflict, divide labor, and maintain their love. Interestingly, it seems that sex and gender, more than the sexual orientation of individuals in a partnership, are the primary causes for this. Male and female sexuality does not fundamentally change as a result of sexual orientation, but the way they express their sexuality is different in same-gender relationships. For example, lesbian women behave differently than heterosexual women do when expressing female sexual desires, starting with prolonged time invested in sexual interactions. Gay men differ from heterosexual men by reflecting a stronger sex drive, which characterizes males in general. Both different-gender and same-gender couples find themselves questioning compatibility based on personalities, values, and beliefs. Both types of couples do their best to navigate the highs and lows of life and challenges such as how to raise one partner&#8217;s self-esteem, financial budgets, religion and spirituality, politics, etc. Just like different-gender relationships, same-gender relationships create the responsibility for partners to do their best to keep promises to each other, avoid unnecessary arguing as much as humanly possible, continuously strengthen their bond, nourish each other without forgetting self-care, and maintain intimacy with their significant others.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<h2>Gender</h2>\n<p>It once seemed like gender reveal parties were taking over Facebook. They were creative, engaging, and a big part of a relationship. Now, it seems like Facebook could be a thing of the past, along with gender reveal parties. Why has gender historically been such a crucial part of an individual’s identity and had such a big impact on a relationship? Perhaps if we explore that we will understand why gender reveal parties were created (perhaps not). We will however, dive into how gender affects a relationship. Discussions about gender have greatly changed over time. People once referred to brains as being either blue or pink. It may seem funny now that there are majors offered at Universities that are dedicated to studying gender, but the way the world used to view gender built a wall between people greater than any wall that could be built today would, should such a terrible thing occur. How truly different are women and men?</p>\n<p>By the time a baby is three months old, it already shows a clear preference for female faces. One of the first things we do when we see someone’s face is classify it as male or female. Attempting to categorize faces has become automatic in our world. Faces that are more easily recognizable as male or female are commonly perceived to be more attractive than faces that are not. This habit of boxing people in without even knowing them also includes assumptions about their socioeconomic status, stereotypes, and whether or not they are available for a romantic relationship with us. A person’s sex refers to the biological anatomy they were born with which characterizes males and females of a species. Primary sex characteristics support reproduction (i.e. genitals, sex hormones, chromosomes). Secondary sex characteristics further distinguish females from males and are further developed throughout puberty to indicate fertility and maturity (i.e. breasts, subcutaneous fat in females and facial hair, deeper voices, and larger muscles in males). Historically, research comparing and contrasting sexes in humans led to assumptions that that there were only two, male and female. There was also a binary assumption that these two sexes are divided in a way that does not change and that the two do not overlap. Contrastingly, scientists have found that many animal species have less rigid sex distinctions. For example, slugs and snails have features of both sexes and clownfish switch between the sexes throughout their lives. Modern research has found human biology to have less rigid sex distinctions than previously thought. Sure, most people have chromosomes which clearly match DNA patterns labeled as male (x and y chromosome) or female (two x chromosomes). However, some people are born with less clear DNA patterns that vary in chromosome numbers. Some people are not born with body parts that clearly fit a female category with a vagina and ovaries or a male category with a penis and testes. 1-2% of all people actually identify as being intersex and having chromosomes or physical characteristics that cannot be clearly labeled as male or female. Finding the various ways biological markers of sex in humans can behave has led to questioning of the original binary assumption that one is either male or female. Invisible to the eye and causing even more questions is the problem that most sex characteristics are invisible or hidden. We don’t see someone’s chromosomes or hormones when we first meet someone, and most of the time we don’t see someone’s genitals when we first meet them. We try to classify them as male or female based on how they behave, their clothes, accessories, and how they present themselves which is not shaped by biology but by culture. By doing this, we are no longer thinking about sex, which is based on biology, but gender which is based on attitudes, traits, and tertiary sex characteristics; behaviors a specific culture categorizes as masculine or feminine and the expectations and beliefs about acceptable and appropriate social roles for men and women. Gender expectations are everywhere and affect our daily lives. Common expectations include how people should dress, who is qualified to be the head of a household, who can be a religious leader, who can be in charge of corporations and governments, and how one should behave in a relationship. This doesn’t just affect how societies and individuals prescribe masculine and feminine behaviors for others, it strongly affects how people perceive themselves as masculine or feminine. Realizing and recognizing that gender’s a social construct supports the fact that one’s gender identity does not have to match one’s sex (biological and physical characteristics). People with a gender identity that matches their assigned sex at birth are cisgender. Transgender people make an explicit distinction between their sex assigned at birth and their gender. Sometimes altering their bodies with hormone therapy, surgery, or both to change their assigned sex to the sex that better aligns with how they see themselves. Many transgender people choose to dress differently, change their name, and ask to be addressed by a different pronoun.</p>\n<h2>Gender Expression</h2>\n<p>One does not have to identify as transgender to express their gender identity diversely. For example, the famous aviator Amelia Earhart identified as a woman, but her gender expressions were generally associated with men. She was heavily invested in her work, unwilling to commit to a relationship, wanted to keep her sexual options open, and had an inclination to disengage and assert control. There are different ways a single gender can be expressed even among people who identify as having the same gender. Researchers are working hard to describe the different ways this is possible and have expanded on the outdated idea of an opposite-sex relationship or a dimension ranging from masculine to feminine by realizing this creates problems. In a world where traits classified as masculine are respected and rewarded more than feminine ones, defining women as lacking masculine traits is not okay. Alternatively, these traits can be better understood as two distinct dimensions. Anyone can be described as relatively high or low in stereotypically masculine qualities and separately as relatively high or low in stereotypically feminine qualities. Historically, traits seen as desirable in men are associated with having power, and traits seen as desirable with women are associated with serving others. Gender stereotypes typically reinforce social structures which give control and authority to men. Interestingly, expressing so-called masculine traits predict objective career success indicators while expressing so-called feminine traits predict the ability to form a long-lasting relationship. Researchers know masculine and feminine stereotypes do not accurately distinguish between people who identify as male or female. They know that regardless of gender identity, anyone can express masculine and feminine traits to varying degrees. Androgynous people express both masculine and feminine traits. They are less restricted, thus have an advantage over people who are more stereotypically masculine or feminine. Androgynous people tend to have higher self-esteems, less anxiety and higher levels of emotional intelligence. They readily express their emotions and are more adaptable to various situations. As a result, they are more desirable partners and are more secure in their relationship. It seems every day there are less people who subscribe to the old usage of masculine and feminine labels.</p>\n<h2>The Relationship between Gender and Behavior</h2>\n<p>Gender schemas are the cognitive representations which organize ideas and beliefs about what it means to be a man or a woman. They alter how we perceive and relate to others, especially in a relationship. Studies show that when men think they are negotiating how to divide labor with a coworker they cannot see and assume is a woman they negotiate more aggressively and assign their co-worker more feminine tasks. When women were incorrectly perceived to be men in the study, they were less likely to choose feminine tasks for themselves. This means that being perceived as a certain gender affects behavior, which also affects a relationship. The two imperfect categories of female and male have historically shaped how people think about each other and about intimacy in a relationship and continue to do so. A study found that the way people present themselves on social media supports the various ways a range of behaviors, affiliations and communication habits are shaped by ideas of gender. Self-identified women mostly <span class=\"markk72qjiwsa\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">post</span>ed about friends, family, and their relationship while self-identified men mostly <span class=\"markk72qjiwsa\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">post</span>ed about objects instead of people, feeling angry and using curse words. The biological makings of women and men are pretty stable but what it means to be a woman or man varies historically, geographically, socially and culturally. For example, in the United States the idea that pink is for girls and blue is for boys was once reversed because blue was seen as delicate and pink was seen as being a stronger color. Fortunately, there have been movements which have led to more flexibility in expected and accepted behaviors of women and men in or out of a relationship, especially in western countries like the United States. For example, more women have joined the workplace and graduate from higher level learning institutions such as graduate school than ever before, and there are many more stay-at-home dads. Unfortunately, the World Health Organization has found women to continue to be described as vulnerable and men as strong and independent world-wide, which threatens the health of both women and men.</p>\n<h2>Similarities and Differences in Men and Women</h2>\n<p>Ideas and perceptions of gender are evolving but the categories, women and men, are still as powerful and influential as ever. Combining research on one variable, like whether someone identifies as a man or woman to another characteristic like empathy, aggression, or sex drive to indicate the degree of similarity between men and women on a particular characteristic. The number that captures the degree of similarity between men and women is known as a d statistic. When d = 0, men and women don’t differ on the characteristic in question. The further away d is from zero, the more men and women differ on this characteristic. Negative d values indicate women score higher than men on a specific dimension while positive values indicate men score higher. For example, men are more sexually attracted to women than women are (d= 3.<span class=\"mark32zva1fie\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">5</span>2) and that women are more sexually attracted to men than men are (d= -3.99). This supports that different-sex attraction is more common than same-sex attraction. However, d values rarely exceed 1. For the social media <span class=\"markk72qjiwsa\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">post</span>s study d= .63 meaning women and men overlapped by at least 75 percent and used similar words even though there was an average difference.</p>\n<p>On average, men are more physically and verbally aggressive than women but when provoked, d =.17. and there isn’t a big difference between how aggressive men and women are. On average, women are more skilled at expressing emotions than men, while men are more likely to make intrusive interruptions. On average, women are more likely than men to seek out emotional support to cope and discuss challenges faced. On average, women are more likely to emphasize social class and ambition when describing their preferences for a relationship partner while men are more likely to prioritize physical attractiveness. On average, women are more likely to feel anxious, guilty, and fearful about sex while men are more likely to have a more positive attitude about sex in an established relationship and even more in a casual relationship. On average, women and men reported similar levels of happiness and self-esteem. Accumulated research suggests women and men are not that different differing more in degrees in regard to a specific characteristic than in having different characteristics altogether. The average scores of women and men on social and psychological characteristics are more similar than dissimilar and when there are differences, those differences are generally small.</p>\n<p>Social scientists generally agree on validity of similarities and differences between women and men but there’s controversy on the approach to understanding what those findings mean, especially for a relationship. For example, it was found that on average men are more aggressive than women but an explanation for why was not found. What is responsible, nature or nurture? Are men biologically predisposed to being more aggressive which implies innate and unchanging differences between women and men? Is it a matter of nurture, societies and cultures providing more opportunities for men to be aggressive than women? That suggests what people believe about gender is a social construct and can be deconstructed.</p>\n<h2>Evolution’s Explanation</h2>\n<p>Evolutionarily speaking, women and men have faced similar challenges and now share various similar abilities. In order to successfully reproduce, they adapted to different challenges. Offspring require using limited reproductive resources, time, and energy during and after birth from women. Men don’t have limited reproductive resources and in fact donate from an endless supply of sperm with no comparable obligations. Even though men can and do contribute to raising children, mothers have a greater burden in reproduction. Evolution has found reproductive realities to imply the kinds of mates women and men prefer for a romantic relationship. Females prefer males who are able and willing to provide resources and protection for them and their offspring. Males prefer females that are physically attractive and youthful because male reproductive efforts are limited by the availability of healthy and fertile females. Since men don’t benefit from investing resources into children fathered by others, they seek out women who are trustworthy and faithful. These preferences are consistent cross-culturally and throughout history; women prioritize status and resources and men prioritize fertility indicated by physical attraction and youth. Intrasexual competition, the ways women and men compete for advantage in the mating marketplace also demonstrates evolved differences between men and women. Evolutionary psychology suggests differences in how women and men attract, keep a relationship, and replace partners can be explained by the unique problems our male and female ancestors faced and is consistent with modern differences today. However, anthropology fact checks certain findings of evolutionary psychology and warns us not to suggest that stereotypes about gender differences should be necessarily reversed but to be open to available data from anthropology and biology to examine what supports existing stereotypes or their exact opposite.</p>\n<h2>Learned Differences Affect Intimate Relationships</h2>\n<p>An individual’s capacity to alter the behavior and experiences of others while also resisting the influence others have on them is their power. This is extremely relevant in an intimate relationship because the roles men and women often have in society, both in the workplace and at home, are not equal. There is a disproportionate amount of men as members of the United States supreme court, as first responders in emergencies, and as CEOs of fortune <span class=\"mark32zva1fie\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">5</span>00 companies. Why? What does this unequal allocation of power and status across genders say to new generations? Social structural theory explains that differences in how money, power, and other resources are divided between women and men are important because this gender-based inequality affects social expectations for men and women such as which roles involving authority and decision making they will occupy and the steps they will take to meet expectations. Society doesn’t just teach these gender-expectations and stereotypes, it punishes those who dare to challenge the status quo. This is seen in reactions to parents who decide not to assign a gender to their children, and in violence against transgender people. When someone identifies as having a particular gender but violates social expectations for it, they are viewed less favorable and their actions are judged more harshly. Furthermore, their sexual identities are questioned. At an early age, children learn and behave according to these social restrictions to avoid being bullied. Gender-identity expectations correlated with unequal power keep people on certain paths in their intimate relationship and career lives and keep them from pursuing other paths in life. For example, when a child commits to becoming a police officer, they figure out it would make sense to behave aggressively to fulfill expectations and skill requirements for such an influential, dominant role. Contrastingly, if a child commits to a more submissive role, they’ll realize that developing cooperative and empathetic behaviors is the way to go. Patriarchal societies in which men have more power and resources than women reward men for independent and assertive behaviors while rewarding women for emotional sensitivity and sacrifice. All in all, the social structural perspective explains gender differences by examining unequal access to power and status which is reinforced by men behaving in ways that give them more superiority while women promote cooperation, nurture others, and adapt to the inferior roles available to them. Gender differences are not caused by genetic differences, they are made from social structures and maintained by unequal opportunities which place different limitations on women and men.</p>\n<h2>What This Means for a Relationship</h2>\n<p>Whether men prefer younger hot partners and women prefer older rich partners depends on how empowered women are in a particular culture and how equal men and women are viewed as being in that culture. In cultures where women are more empowered, gender differences in mate preferences are significantly smaller. As female empowerment and gender equality increase, women’s preference for older partners and men’s preference for younger ones decrease. This contradicts the assumption evolutionary psychology makes about cross-cultural mate preferences. Power structures lead to specific behaviors being associated with a particular gender. When women have more power, make more money, and hold a higher position in a company, they don’t behave the same way women without these resources do. The same can be said about the capacity for one person to accurately know what someone else is thinking, referred to as empathic accuracy. When men are told that instead of making them more feminine, empathic accuracy will actually make them more romantically appealing, they perform just as well as women do in expressing, interpreting, and decoding emotions.</p>\n<p>Even preferences about sexual behavior are not hardwired but responsive to social changes. For example, premarital sex is more widely accepted than it once was. As a result, more young adults are sexually active. Interestingly, in the 1950s only 13% of young women had engaged in sex but by the 1990s 47% had engaged in sex. During this time, the negative consequences of sex for women such as unwanted pregnancies and social judgement also decreased. Gender is an extremely weak indicator of how someone will behave, especially compared to the influence of power and social status on behavior. The fact that gender expectations and behaviors have changed over time along with experimental research supports the finding that unequal distribution of power and status is what gives birth to gender differences in most societies.</p>\n<p>Prior to the industrial revolution nobody talked about or tried to explain who was more responsible for work or family life because they were the same thing. Every member of the household, women, men, and children, contributed to the family farm. Everything changed with the development of manufacturing as family responsibilities split in two. The men left the house to work and women stayed at home to maintain the household and take care of children. Back then, both the men leaving the home to work and the women working at home were working in harsh conditions. Factory jobs that working-class men had were often flooded with safety hazards and women didn’t have washing machines, refrigerators and other helpful devices that are now available. However, men were getting paid for their work and women were not. Soon, men’s jobs were described as activities they pursued for money and status while women’s work at home was belittled as simply being their responsibility and something they did because it was in their nature. This led to the social hierarchy exaggerating the differences between life at home and the world. Worst of all, it changed the ideal personalities of women and men and made women financially dependent on their romantic relationship.</p>\n<p>Now, research has found that men have strong physiological responses when their competence or dominance is threatened while women respond more strongly when experiencing disagreements in their relationship.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Awareness</h2>\n<p>The way men and women have been socialized to establish and maintain intimacy even affects how aware of their relationship they will be. For example, if Isabel and Christian introduce each other to their families, they will probably discuss how they met, and how their first date went. Isabel is likely to recall more accurate details and speak through the perspective of the couple than Christian is, because on average, women are more aware of their relationship than men are. Women develop mental representations of their relationship that are emotionally richer which explains why men are 8-10 times less likely than women to know why they are getting a divorce.</p>\n<p>A summary of eight studies using a diary method and rankings to rate interactions with male friends versus female friends from 1 for superficial to 7 for meaningful shows that on average, men rate their interactions with their other men 3.4, and women rate their interactions with other women 4.2. Thus, men are not less capable of deep dialogue or expressing their feelings, they are just less likely to do so with other men. This is also seen in an intimate relationship such as a marriage. When asked to be supportive, husbands and wives provide virtually the same amount of positive, neutral, and negative behaviors. Men don’t lack the basic skills for expressing their emotions or being supportive, they can step up when a situation calls for it but, are likely to increase criticism when they increase support. For example, if Joseph’s wife Nicole vents about not having the time and effort she invests in her work valued by her supervisor, Joseph is likely to validate her feelings but criticize her, “ I know your supervisor doesn’t seem to value how hard you work or the work you do, life can suck, but I told you to quit months ago.” Men are not incapable of emotional work women do, they are just less likely to do it because they are discouraged from doing so, told it’s not their job, and risk being perceived as weak or less manly. Women are rewarded for empathic accuracy and nurturing those around them and are told it is their job in the relationship. Research on caregiving has even found that if a husband has a wife with cancer, he will have the same stress level as a husband with a wife that doesn’t have cancer while a wife with a husband who has cancer will be just as distressed as the husband battling the cancer.</p>\n<h2>Interest in Sex</h2>\n<p>Fortunately, physiologically speaking, women and men have sexual response cycles that are nearly identical. They are also equally physiologically capable of experiencing sexual pleasure and orgasm. Unfortunately, women and men receive vastly different messages about how acceptable it is to enjoy sex. From a young age, men are culturally pressured to want sex, pursue sex, and be ready for sex when an opportunity arises. Women receive contradicting messages and are shamed for expressing too much interest in sex or for expressing too little. They are encouraged to be seductive to men but to be chaste and pure. The media then further complicates things by portraying unrealistic body standards which leaves women unhappy with and ashamed of their bodies. We live in a world where sex is frequently a source of distress, threat and possible trauma for women on top of possibly causing unwanted pregnancies but also a world where sex is a source of rewarding pleasure for men. Since women face many disadvantages that men do not when it comes to physical intimacy, they are not given the same opportunity men have to holistically enjoy it. Acknowledging how socially and physically risky sex can be for women is the first step in a proper attempt to understanding gender differences in sexual interest and behavior, such as why men are more motivated to have sex. Research has found extensive lists of behaviors emphasizing gender differences in sexual behaviors and physical intimacy as including but not being limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Men have more spontaneous thoughts about sex in a day.</li>\n<li>Men have more sexual fantasies than women.</li>\n<li>Men have more varied sexual fantasies women have.</li>\n<li>Men want to have sex more frequently than women do.</li>\n<li>Men want a more sexual partners than women do.</li>\n<li>Men masturbate more than women do.</li>\n<li>Men self-report an interest in a wider variety of sexual practices than women do.</li>\n<li>Men are less willing to pass up the opportunity to have sex.</li>\n<li>Men are more willing to make greater sacrifices than women for sexual opportunities.</li>\n<li>Men are more likely than women to initiate sex.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Research also shows that women are more judged and stigmatized for engaging in the exact same behaviors men are praised for. Regardless of their gender, people perceive a woman who accepts an invitation to have sex with a stranger as less intelligent, less mentally healthy, and more promiscuous and riskier than a man who accepts the same invitation. Women are not blessed with the social and cultural support that men receive for pursuing and enjoying sex but are cursed with a greater threat of violence and social judgement than men are. With this in mind, it’s not hard to understand why even though women and men have an equal physiological capacity for sexual pleasure, women are on average less inclined than men to pursue or enjoy sex.</p>\n<h2>Ending a Relationship</h2>\n<p>Women are more likely than men to be aware of their relationship and are more likely to recognize problems in the relationship. This coincides with how women accept the need for relationship counseling earlier than men do and are more likely to initiate contact with practitioners and or more likely than husbands to want a divorce, bring up filing for one, and to actually file for a divorce. Women are socialized to be more sensitive than men to the quality and stability of their relationship and will likely be the first to detect what’s wrong with their relationship. Women are more likely than men to be financially dependent on their relationship partners and understandably so, if your survival depends on someone else caring for you, you’re going to make sure your relationship is solid, or you will find another romantic partner.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Once expectations about roles and responsibilities in a romantic relationship are recognized as being negotiable in a relationship and not pre-determined by society or culture, couples will have to question what many generations have, dare I say, blindly accepted and implemented about an intimate relationship. Some couples may experience distress because challenging our assumptions about gender can be confusing and threaten what we see as normal. Other couples will be able to breathe better and be more satisfied with their relationship once they are liberated and embrace an opportunity to choose how sensitive, aggressive, emotional, sexual, independent, and connected they will be as individuals, and as a happy couple in their relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<h2>Social Exchange Theory</h2>\n<p>Unlike the evolutionary perspective and attachment theory, social exchange theory is mindfully focused on the present. It focuses on how people make decisions, make an investment in, and evaluate their relationships in the present moment. It was born in the 1960s after principles of sociology, anthropology and psychology were combined with psychologist B.F Skinner’s behaviorism which expands ideas on rewards and punishments leading to a broader movement in psychology and ultimately a description of social interactions in economic terms. According to social exchange theory everyone tries to get the most out of every social interaction by exchanging social goods such as information, status, and approval. It even predicts what people will do in social situations by specifically identifying how an investment in a relationship and behaviors will pay off and how people will feel about the outcomes of their actions. It predicts if an investment will be worth it. It is used to understand behaviors not only in administrations, jails, or hospitals but in intimate relationships. For example, relationship satisfaction can be seen as subjective to an individual in a particular relationship, but social exchange theory evaluates what a partner is receiving from into a relationship during a specific time. It then compares it to each investment a partner makes into a relationship during a specific time. Relationship stability is seen as the result of each partner’s decision to stay in a relationship and nourish it or end it. Through a social exchange lens, the negotiation of costs and rewards in a relationship determines how a relationship will grow and flourish or decay. A spotlight on how important and relevant social exchange theory is that Gary Becker, who researched costs and rewards which lead to marital decisions received a Nobel Peace Prize in economics.</p>\n<h2>Interdependence in Intimate Relationships</h2>\n<p>Two psychologists, John Thibaut and Harold Kelley were the first to introduce the defining feature of all relationships to be how interdependent partners are; how much one partners actions affect the other partner. Thus, they referred to their perspective on social exchange theory as interdependence theory as it focused on romantic relationships. They were most interested in the effects of interdependence and the rules which predict how interdependent partners will interact, and how the partners will assess the results of their actions. Social exchange theory’s fundamental assumption about intimate relationships is that people evaluate and make decisions about their relationships just like they evaluate and make economic decisions. They decide whether or not to make an investment in a relationship similar to how they decide to make an economic investment. This approach defines the ways a relationship fulfills the needs and desires of a partner as rewards and the elements of the relationship which prevent partners from fulfilling their needs or desires as costs. We, humans, seek to maximize rewards and minimize costs as much as possible and are usually pretty good at finding ways to do so in every situation.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Rewards</h2>\n<p>The potential rewards an intimate relationship may provide are often broken down into material rewards and social rewards. For example, a relationship may provide material rewards like food and protection and social rewards like emotional and psychological support through companionship, validation, and security. On the other hand, the potential costs of an intimate relationship include the exact opposite of potential rewards. For example, financial drain, emotional and psychological pain through frequent conflicts, trust issues, especially concerning jealousy, and even physical abuse. Even high-quality relationships involve costs. Intimate relationships require an investment of time and energy, leaving less time for pursuing other interests and often also costing each partner opportunities to explore alternative relationships. Costs like missing out on getting to know other attractive potential partners, job opportunities that would require relocating away from a partner, or even hobbies that a partner would disapprove of and request be discontinued are referred to as opportunity costs. Analyzing the pros and cons, the rewards and costs of an intimate relationship can be hard. Most relationships do not consist of only rewards or only costs, they have a combination of the two. For example, you might enjoy cuddling and being silly with your partner but extremely dislike the way they take too long in the shower or have a hard time adjusting your habits like not blasting music to avoid bothering them. Social exchange theory breaks this process down and clarifies it with the following formula:</p>\n<p align=\"center\">OUTCOME = REWARDS &#8211; COSTS</p>\n<p>Perhaps friends and family have asked you to determine whether you should stay in a relationship or not. However, standards for comparing how rewarding rewards or how costly costs in a relationship are do not exist. Most people would not pursue an intimate relationship if they predict it will make them miserable but there’s no way of knowing exactly what the rewards or costs of a relationship will be in advance. Outside of fairy tales, people have to rely on a combination of what their gut intuitively tells them about a relationship, their past experiences with intimacy, and external factors like guidance from friends and family to estimate how rewarding or costly a relationship will be. They have to decide whether or not the investment they are inclined to make will lead to satisfaction. Subjective probability is your guess of how rewarding or costly a relationship will most likely be. Keeping this in mind, perceived rewards or costs that are easily believable are more likely to influence subjective probability because a smaller reward that you are likely to receive is more appealing than a bigger reward that you will probably not receive. This is why instead of infatuating over a relationship with celebrities, people tend to turn towards their social circles and make an investment there when looking for intimate partners.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Just because the rewards of a relationship outweigh the costs does not mean partners are satisfied enough to continue to make an investment in and remain in the relationship. Social exchange theory says satisfaction in a relationship is evaluated by a partner comparing the perceived outcomes of their relationship with a standard comparison level (CL); in other words, with what they think they deserve. Having positive experiences with intimate relationships is not enough, we seek to have the positive outcomes from intimate relationships exceed what we think we deserve. We want a return on our investment that is higher than what we invested. When a watermelon seed is planted, a watermelon is expected. If a watermelon seed is planted and a watermelon does not grow, the seed is then evaluated as an investment that did not pay off. When we do not experience a relationship that makes us happier than we think we deserve to be, even if it’s a positive relationship, chances are we will be dissatisfied. An equation to determine this is:</p>\n<p align=\"center\">SATISFACTION = OUTCOME – Comparison Level (CL)</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, this equation attempts to determine the satisfaction a relationship results in, which has subjective factors like a predicted outcome and a standard comparison level of what an individual believes they deserve. This is why different people reach drastically different conclusions about the same relationship. Different people will have various opinions about how to make an investment in the same relationship. Think of someone whose investment in a relationship is less than what they get out of a relationship. They are in an intimate relationship which appears to have more rewards than it does costs relationship but isn’t satisfied with it and complains about it all the time. Imagine this person has a highly intelligent, ambitious, friendly, caring, attractive partner which manages conflict constructively. Doesn’t that sound ideal? Their comparison level is so high that a relationship that others would be more than happy to have does not make them happy. Contrastingly, think of someone who is happy in a relationship that appears to have more costs than it does rewards. This person is making a great investment but the return they are receiving is not so great. Imagine this person has an inconsiderate, greedy, lazy, and rude partner. Their comparison level is so low that they don’t expect the negative outcomes of their relationship to be as negative as they really are.</p>\n<h2>Miss Independent?</h2>\n<p>Social exchange theory doesn’t just touch on how people feel about their intimate relationships or rate their intimate partners. It also examines how people behave in their relationships, specifically, whether they choose to continue to make an investment in or end a relationship. How satisfied a person is with their relationship is independent of whether or not they will stay in it. The way satisfaction is calculated depends on how partners assess their relationship. How much a person depends on a relationship is directly linked to the available alternatives to the relationship, including being alone. No one wants to feel caged in a relationship. Feeling too free to leave a relationship, however, is correlated with how committed partners will be to stay in a relationship and continue to make an investment in it. The way an individual perceives potential alternatives to a relationship is referred to as the comparison for alternatives (CL<sub>alt</sub>). For example, whether a young woman named <span class=\"markb9bqylrap\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">Valentina</span> has high or low standards for her current intimate relationship, and whether or not she is satisfied with the relationship, she is dependent on her current relationship to the extent that its outcomes are better than the outcomes available elsewhere.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">DEPENDENCY = OUTCOME – CL<sub>alt</sub><sub> </sub></p>\n<p>Even if <span class=\"markb9bqylrap\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">Valentina</span> is in a happy relationship with Gianni, and to many outsiders, a relationship with a man like Gianni appears satisfying and worth maintaining, it might not be hard for her to leave the relationship. Let’s make this “<span class=\"markb9bqylrap\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">Valentina</span>” a famous actor and model. No matter how satisfying her relationship is or how positive the outcomes of the relationship could be, because of her high comparison level alternatives (CL<sub>alt</sub>) is she is aware that equally positive or more positive outcomes are available to her elsewhere since she has access to more alternatives than the average person does. This also decreases the chances she will be dependent on the relationship even though it may be extremely satisfying. People with exceptionally high comparison level alternatives (CL<sub>alt</sub>) like Brad Pitt often make decisions the general public does not understand. Brad Pitt’s exceptionally high comparison level alternatives (CL<sub>alt</sub>) can help us understand why shortly after divorcing Jennifer Aniston he began an intimate relationship with another gorgeous and talented actress, Angelina Jolie. The average person does not have the comparison level alternatives (CL<sub>alt</sub>) that a celebrity like Brad Pitt does which helps explain why people stay in unsatisfying and even toxic, abusive relationships.</p>\n<h2>Comparison Level Alternatives in Relationships</h2>\n<p>An important thing to understand is comparison level alternatives (CL<sub>alt</sub>) are not necessarily alternate relationships. Alternatives to an intimate relationship include all alternatives to being in that specific relationship, which includes the obstacles one would have to overcome like family members pushing for a relationship and even being single. Another powerful obstacle to overcome when wishing a relationship would end is finding secure income, as many partners rely on each other to maintain a household and ensure all bills get paid. Furthermore, the time, energy, and other resources that have been invested into a relationship often keep people in relationships that don’t make them happy simply because they don’t want to “lose” the resources they invested into the relationship. Relationships that involve children often push people to stay in the relationship even if it doesn’t make them happy because children, a shared home, and the time invested would possibly be lost or threatened. Barriers like these, which act as external forces keeping partners together and substantial investments in a relationship reduce the attractiveness of leaving a relationship. Thinking about relationships through the lens of the social exchange theory may appear to take the romance out of intimate relationships but the external forces keeping a relationship going, forcing two potentially people unhappy with their intimate relationship only become apparent once partners consider leaving the relationship. If <span class=\"markb9bqylrap\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">Valentina</span> and Gianni’s relationship is not satisfying them, they will think about how their relationship has few rewards and more costs, making ending the relationship a real possibility. In satisfying relationships, partners mostly focus on rewards like love and companionship as the reasons for why they stay together. If <span class=\"markb9bqylrap\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">Valentina</span> and Gianni’s relationship includes high attraction and is high in satisfaction, then they won’t focus on measuring every single investment they make and will pay less attention to alternatives to their relationship.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Commitment</h2>\n<p>Defining the difference between satisfaction and dependence breaks down the reasons why one might stay in an intimate relationship. Partners are satisfied and want to stay in it, or they are dependent and have to stay in it. Commitment, the intention to stay in and connected to a relationship is the sum of all internal and external factors which keep a relationship alive.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">COMMITMENT = SATISFACTION + DEPENDENCE</p>\n<p>The more a relationship has positive outcomes, the more things in the relationship are fulfilling  and partners feel the love they are receiving exceeds their comparison level (CL) and those outcomes are better than the comparison level alternatives (CL<sub>alt</sub>) the higher the probability is that partners will be committed to their relationship.</p>\n<p>Research on intimate relationships has been guided by the equations that social exchange theory shows to help explain how people behave in various relationships and how likely they will continue or end a relationship. There are many memes on the internet about partners that appear committed to a relationship holding their partner’s hand while looking at hot singles nearby. Census data has proven that partners with less perceived alternatives to their relationship are more likely to stay in the relationship. In the same manner, singles that live in neighborhoods containing a lot of eligible partners are more likely to marry and divorce while singles living in neighborhoods containing fewer eligible partners are less likely to get married and less likely to divorce if they are married. Science on intimate relationships no longer only inspects individual qualities in partners when a relationship ends, assuming that character flaws led to the relationship ending. Thanks to the social exchange theory, science on intimate relationships has now broadened its studies to also include external variables that may keep partners together or draw them apart.</p>\n<h2>Eyes Are Windows to the Soul</h2>\n<p>Interestingly, modern science often finds evidence to prove what our ancestors tried to teach us. Social exchange theory examines how committed partners behave in relationships when they are satisfied or dependent on their relationship. When partners are committed, it shows in their eyes and in their actions. While pupils dilating while looking at a significant other might not be widely accepted as evidence of love, the conscious decision to protect and maintain a relationship is more easily observed through actions. For example, partners in committed relationships are less likely to look at alternative partners the way they look at their significant other. When asked to rate the physical attractiveness of alternative partners, committed partners rate alternative partners lower than single people would rate those same people. Committed partners diminish the value of alternatives to their intimate relationship and are consequently more satisfied with their relationships. They also are more willing to make sacrifices for their partner and forgive their partner’s wrongdoings. Additionally, they are more likely to manage conflict constructively even when they feel dissatisfied with the relationship because they believe the relationship is worth more than leaving the relationship. Committed partners evaluate the costs of leaving their relationship as being worse than the costs of maintaining their relationship and the rewards of the investment they make in their relationship as being far better than the rewards of leaving the relationship. Happily committed partners take pride in each investment they make in their relationship because their goal is not to win arguments or to squeeze everything they can out of their partner, but to improve how they love their partner each and every single day.</p>\n<h2>Economics in Intimate Relationships</h2>\n<p>Social exchange theory does not take the beauty out of love or rename romance as a fair tradeoff. It provides a broad framework for addressing the various factors which affect whether a relationship will succeed and prevail or fail and end. It repackages psychological variables that can be subjective such as personal view of a significant other, feelings of love, alternatives to the relationship, cultural and social norms and standards, and even socioeconomic status by proposing a way to evaluate them as economic variables, which facilitates the age-old process of evaluating the pros and cons of a relationship to determine if an investment is worth it. It can be assumed that seeds for relationships are planted because both partners predict an investment will indeed be worth it. They both predict many rewards, few costs, and outcomes that are more appealing than their comparison levels (CL). Social exchange theory acknowledges that the opinions of a partner about their relationship can change over time possibly leading to a decline in relationship satisfaction when the anticipated rewards are less attractive or less obtainable and new costs are discovered. However, it does not address these questions or try to explain how an initially satisfying relationship becomes less satisfying. It focuses on how couples trying to figure out whether to continue to make an investment in or end a relationship can determine what is most rewarding for them and will lead to the most satisfaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<h2>Relationship Attachment Theory</h2>\n<p>Many mushy metaphors about intimate relationships are cute but don’t explain how experiences in early childhood serve as building blocks for future relationships. Regardless of whether or not Mercury is in retrograde, some people tend to repeat relationship habits without noticing.</p>\n<p>Attachment theory examines an individual’s childhood to understand the foundation for their experiences with relationships as adults. According to attachment theory, the bonds we make with our primary caregivers during infancy and early childhood shape the intimate relationships we have as adults.</p>\n<h2>Fundamental Relationship Assumptions</h2>\n<p>Mainstream music on the radio commonly refers to our innate need for love and affection. Humans are not capable of feeding and protecting themselves during childhood, they need constant care. Although over the years independence increases for most people, their core need for healthy relationships does not. Babies don’t need tutorials on how to cry or smile, they naturally engage in behaviors to draw attention from attachment figures that can feed and protect them during their childhood. Creating and maintaining an attachment with an attachment figure that provides a child with comfort and care sets the tone for how future relationships will be created and maintained. How sensitive a caregiver is to their child’s cries is also evolutionary adaptive.</p>\n<h2>The Relationship Attachment Behavior System</h2>\n<p>The attachment behavior system is like an internal control system which children use to monitor three key variables:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Their internal states</li>\n<li>Their caregiver’s availability and responsiveness</li>\n<li>The presence of threats in the environment</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This system serves as a guide to increase behaviors that maximize physical proximity to a caregiver and the feeling of security. Children with parents that respond to their needs are more likely to grow up and successfully reproduce. They feel safe from threat or harm and secure enough to explore their environment, whether that’s playing with toys or making friends. On the other hand, children that don’t react or behave in a way that ensures they will be taken care of during their childhood, or that have insensitive caregivers are less likely to successfully reproduce or have fulfilling relationships. When children feel their security is threatened, their fear and anxiety usually motivates them to try to restore closeness with their attachment figure. However, sometimes their fear and anxiety hyperactivates their attachment behavior system, leaving them terrified of abandonment. When children aren’t able to restore their relationship with their caregiver, their attachment behavior system deactivates the usual behaviors and reactions they use to get the attention and care they need. This further hinders their drive to restore closeness with their caregiver. Ideally, a reunion with their primary caregiver will occur and anxiety levels will return to normal and the cycle will reset.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Attachment Models</h2>\n<p>There are two main ways children can be programmed depending on how their caregivers treated them. Infants with responsive caregivers who are consistently warm and sensitive, especially when infants are upset, grow up believing they are worthy of love and attention, and that people are generally caring and dependable. Infants with inconsistent or harsh caregivers that are controlling, unpredictable, or overly intrusive when infants are upset, grow up believing they are unworthy of attention and affection and that caregivers are not dependable or trustworthy. Experiences with caregivers during our childhood pile up to create a working model in us. This working model is like an internal psychological structure which represents subconscious and conscious beliefs, expectations, and how people feel about themselves, others, and relationships. Think about the relationships you have seen. There have been connections found between how people relate to their partners and how they relate to their children. This supports that the attachment behavior system in intimate relationships and caregiver-child relationships are the same. Internal working models link childhood experiences with caregivers to adult romantic relationships.</p>\n<p>The bridge to adulthood that most people walk on is full of fog, which causes a shift in their perspective, especially, in priorities. The focus of attachment is less on parental figures and more on a romantic partner. We rely less on physical proximity as we paint a mental picture of who people are and what they mean to us. Technology helps with this by providing us with physical pictures of a romantic partner, which reminds us of the intimate bond and comforts us when we want to see them but can’t. Internal working models continue learning and we adapt according to new experiences in relationships, which continue affecting subsequent relationships. The domino effect is a good way to visualize how good or bad experiences in relationships affect future relationships. For example, getting lied to or cheated on in a long-term relationship can shift a secure person to being more insecure about future relationships. The good news is, this means an insecure person who is blessed with an unconditionally supportive and understanding partner can shift to being more secure about future relationships.</p>\n<p>Working models rely on existing information to frame new information. For example, an insecure individual usually believes they are unlovable and may never have a happy fulfilling relationship after a relationship fails, while a secure individual usually attributes the relationship failure to external factors, like bad timing and more easily accepts a lack of chemistry with someone. Working models regulate the expression and resolution of attachment needs.</p>\n<p>Two key functions of the attachment behavior system result in precise differences in how individuals desire and prefer closeness in intimate relationships. The first function allows individuals to detect threats in the environment; feelings of anxiety cause children to seek closeness to their caregiver. When children have constant exposure to an inattentive parent who unavailable, or inconsistent and unpredictable, they develop internal working models which result in chronic anxiety, insecurity, and sensitivity to rejection and abandonment. Such experiences may result in a low sense of self-worth and doubts about deserving love.</p>\n<p>The second function is about whether or not an individual believes their caregiver is available and how likely an individual will turn toward or away from other loved ones when distressed. Usually when children get anxious, they turn toward their caregiver unless they are used to rejection from that caregiver. Instead, that child will have a perspective that warns against trusting others, against attaching, and ultimately lead to unsatisfactory relationships.</p>\n<h2>Four Broad Attachment Styles</h2>\n<p>According to attachment theory, the two main ways adults are different is measured by two dimensions: anxiety and avoidance. A tendency with anxiety about perceived threats to the attachment relationship by a child corresponds with a negative self-view. Another tendency is for avoidance of anxiety about attachment, which corresponds with a pretty negative view of others.</p>\n<p>Think of Internal working models about attachments as a coin with two different sides. Anxiety, with generalized beliefs about one’s value and self-worth is represented by one side. The other side represents avoidance and generalized beliefs about the dependability and trustworthiness of others to meet one’s needs. Combinations of these two different dimensions result in four broad attachment styles: secure, preoccupied, dismissing, and fearful. About 60% of people have a secure attachment style and the rest have different variations of the three insecure attachment styles. Around 70% of people have stable attachment styles throughout their lives.</p>\n<h2>Which Attachment Style Do You Identify With?</h2>\n<p>Humans are motivated to seek comfort and closeness through relationships with others.</p>\n<p>According to evolution, attachment styles are not optional. They are, however, generally stable across different relationships over a lifetime, with the exception of disrupting and difficult life events like death of a caregiver, chronic illness of a caregiver, and experiences involving intimacy and trust during adolescence. We are all affected by our nature and the way we are nurtured. Research shows the same findings about attachment styles and attachment behaviors for same-sex and different-sex couples. A “secure” person will not focus on problems in their relationships or be as agitated discussing those perceived problems like an “insecure” person will. When experiencing relationship conflict, a “secure” person’s view of the relationship is less likely to change than an “insecure” person’s view, which is likely to be very negative while experiencing relationship conflict. A “secure” person is likely to directly communicate their needs in a relationship while a “highly avoidant” person, seeking an intimate relationship will be more indirect. Ironically, “insecure” people have a tendency to perceive more threats and have excessive concerns about their relationships and escalate conflict, which lowers the chances of a relationship succeeding. Some people seem hardwired to “easily” navigate human intimacy but in the end, we are all yearn for comfort and closeness, we just have different approaches to reaching our goals in intimate relationships.</p>\n<p>Note: For this self-check, keep in mind that “anxiety” refers to how much people worry about whether or not other will provide them with care and “avoidance” refers to how much people seek others or keep to themselves.</p>\n<h3>Secure Attachment Style</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low attachment related anxiety</li>\n<li>Low attachment related avoidance</li>\n<li>Positive view of self</li>\n<li>Positive view of others</li>\n<li>Feel worthy of other’s love</li>\n<li>Confident others will be responsible and dependable</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Preoccupied Attachment Style</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>High attachment related anxiety</li>\n<li>Low attachment related avoidance</li>\n<li>Negative view of self</li>\n<li>Positive view of others</li>\n<li>Depend on love from others to reassure, and validate who they are through attention, e.g. rejection leads to doubting self-worth)</li>\n<li>Confident others will be caring and dependable</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dismissing attachment style</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low attachment related anxiety</li>\n<li>Low attachment related avoidance</li>\n<li>Positive view of self</li>\n<li>Negative view of others</li>\n<li>Deny need for closeness and intimate relationships, avoid closeness, and belittle its importance to maintain a positive self-view and negative view of others</li>\n<li>Not confident others will be caring and dependable</li>\n<li>Value independence and self-sufficiency</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fearful attachment style</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>High attachment related anxiety</li>\n<li>Low attachment related avoidance</li>\n<li>Negative view of self</li>\n<li>Negative view of others</li>\n<li>Feel unworthy of care and consideration from others</li>\n<li>Seeks validation from others</li>\n<li>Confident others will be responsible and dependable</li>\n<li>Expect pain and rejection from relationships</li>\n<li>Avoid intimacy and expected discomfort in relationships</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },

      "rendered": "<p>Anxiety can be helpful when it motivates you to accomplish tasks, but it is hurtful when it causes you to avoid what you need to do. Furthermore, when one or both partners are feeling anxious it can sometimes negatively affect the relationship. Maybe one or both of you are nervous about how things are going in the relationship but avoid discussing it because it feels uncomfortable. Alternately, anxiety may make you less productive such that your worries get in the way of accomplishing work or household tasks, which can cause tension in the relationship.</p>\n<p>Below are common cycles couples experience around anxiety as well as tips for breaking out of these cycles. Because every couple is different, it’s important to read through each cycle. You might find that more than one applies to your or your partner’s behavior.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Anxiety that Creates Accommodation</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sometimes, instead of creating outward conflict between the two partners, the non-anxious partner changes his/her behavior to help the anxious partner reduce his/her anxiety. While this can be good in small doses, it can become a problem if the entire relationship becomes organized around the anxiety – a process called “accommodation”. For example, if one person is afraid of being in crowded places, the other partner may start to do all of the shopping and related activities. While that might feel good to the anxious person in the short term (even being viewed as a caring act), it ultimately keeps the anxious person from having the very experiences that would help him/her get over that anxiety.<br />\n</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Non-Anxious Partner</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The more anxious your partner gets, the more you feel you have to be reassure him/her or rearrange everything so he/she won&#8217;t get upset, which can be very stressful for you. </span><span class=\"s1\">Tips to change these situations:</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1. DISCUSS YOUR PLAN</span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before you do anything differently, talk with your partner about why it’s important to change the way the two of you act because of your partner’s anxiety. Be sure to communicate that you really care for your partner. But it’s because you care that you’re going to try to let your partner handle his/her anxiety more independently.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">2. STOP ACCOMMODATING </span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Instead of reassuring your partner that everything is okay and/or taking any tasks to help your partner feel less anxious, step aside and give him/her the chance to practice doing things that make him/her anxious despite feeling distressed.<br />\n</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">3. DISENGAGE YOURSELF</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you find yourself wanting to help your partner with avoiding anxiety-provoking situations, or find yourself &#8220;walking on eggshells&#8221; to make sure he/she is okay, do something else that&#8217;s important to you instead. Try taking a walk, reading a book, or engaging yourself in some other pleasurable activity.<br />\n</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">4. SHOW LOVE</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you have a partner who is anxious, sometimes one of the ways you show your love is through helping with rituals or helping them avoid feared things. Instead, show you care with other actions. Leave him/her a supportive note on the mirror in the morning, give him/her a back rub after a long day, or text them to show you are thinking about him/her during the day. And, when your partner is anxious, be sure to support him/her.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Anxious Partner</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The more your partner gets stressed out when you&#8217;re anxious, the more anxious you feel, and the more you want to do something else to make the anxiety go away. </span><span class=\"s1\">Tips to change these situations:</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">1. TRY IT ON YOUR OWN</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you feel pulled to ask your partner for reassurance that everything will be fine, or help you with something that makes the anxiety go away, try not asking and instead try to stick it out. Though you will likely feel more anxiety right away, in many cases you’ll see that directly addressing the issues that make you anxious eventually <i>reduces</i> your anxiety of those issues in the future. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">2. TEST YOURSELF</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sometimes, when we have been avoiding something for a really long time, when we re-visit it, the feared thing isn’t as scary as we thought. See if you can try out some of the anxiety provoking activities or situations, and make baby steps toward doing more and more activities that used to make you anxious! </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">3. LET YOUR PARTNER OFF THE HOOK</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the reasons your partner helps you (more than might be good for you) is that he/she really cares about you and wants to help you when you feel anxious.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>So, let your partner know that you’re going to try to handle the anxiety on your own.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And let him/her know that’s not because you don’t appreciate the help but that it’s because your anxiety won’t improve if you don’t push yourself.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">4. SEEK OUT HELP</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Would advice from a therapist or physician be an option for you? There are many effective therapies and medications shown to help people struggling with anxiety. Additionally, self-help books or other online programs</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Anxiety that Creates Conflict</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">The anxious partner’s behavior can bother the non-anxious partner. The non-anxious partner may try to help, but if the help he/she offers isn’t what the anxious person wants, he/she can start to feel frustrated. At the same time, if the anxious partner notices the non-anxious partner’s frustration, his/her anxiety might become even worse. Attempts to decrease anxiety may just start the cycle all over again.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Non-Anxious Partner</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The more anxiety your partner shows, the more concerned and frustrated you become, and the more you urge him/her to relax and fix the problem. </span><span class=\"s1\">Tips to change these situations:</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">1. UNDERSTAND IT</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Try to empathize with the anxiety your partner is feeling. If this isn’t a core issue you’re working on in this program, tell your partner you see how difficult it must be for him/her to deal with this. Having an open conversation about how difficult it is for you both can start moving things in a more productive direction and out of the frustrating cycle. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">2. DON’T JUDGE</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Try not to criticize your partner &#8211; that is likely to make his/her stress and anxiety worse. Give your partner some time to figure out how to handle his/her anxiety. Be open to the ideas they share about how you can react constructively. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">3. FOCUS ON SELF-CHANGE</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Make decisions about things you can control, like what <i>you&#8217;ll </i>do when your partner is feeling anxious. Maybe you can remove yourself from the situation, set a timer to allow your partner an agreed upon amount of time to vent, and/or when they are ready, you can problem solve together.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Or, maybe you need to make a plan to do some things on your own you haven’t been able to do because your partner’s anxiety.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Anxious Partner</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The more your partner pushes you to calm down, the more anxious you feel, and the more you want to do something else to make the anxiety go away. </span><span class=\"s1\">Tips to change these situations:</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">1. SHARE YOUR FEELINGS</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If this isn’t a core issue you’re working on in this program, share with your partner how it feels to be anxious. Give him/her a chance to empathize with you. Oftentimes, anxiety is hidden until it explodes. Be aware of how you are feeling and let your partner in. Letting your partner know, especially when they are doing something that contributes to your anxiety, is important. He/she may be totally unaware of what he/she is doing! </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">2. WHAT HELPS?</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Try to tell your partner what you need. For example, maybe you want your partner to comfort and support you rather than try to fix what’s wrong or tell you to calm down. Learning to regulate anxiety on your own is important, but so is letting your partner know what makes it worse. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">3. SEEK OUT HELP</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Would advice from a therapist or physician be an option for you? There are many effective therapies and medications shown to help people struggling with anxiety. Additionally, self-help books or other online programs like this one, but specifically for anxiety may be an option for you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Is a partner from a previous relationship interfering or causing problems in your current relationship? An ex-partner can be a huge external stress on your current relationship. If so, this post will help you identify common problems around exes and get some ideas on how to solve them.</p>\n<h2><strong>Issues Around Ex-partners Can Have Many Forms</strong></h2>\n<p>After a romantic relationship ends, sometimes ex-partners continue to be involved in our lives.  The most common reason is shared custody of children, but problems can also be caused by continued contact with the ex or relationships with shared friends or family members of the ex-partner.  If you’re in this situation, it is likely difficult for you and your partner to agree on boundaries regarding the exes and agree to how much input and/or presence they have in your relationship.  Couples dealing with ex-partners tend to experience one of two common cycles: &#8220;The Ex Drives a Wedge Between Us&#8221; and &#8220;The Ex is a Source of Stress for Both of Us&#8221;</p>\n<h2>THE EX DRIVES A WEDGE BETWEEN US</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, it can be hard to balance the needs / desires of the Ex with the needs / desires of the current relationship. When that happens, it may create fights in the current relationship.</p>\n<h3>The Partner with an Ex</h3>\n<p>You may feel caught between your current partner and your ex. Conflicting opinions or agendas may cause you stress and leave you feeling like you can’t win. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>1. MAKE A PLAN</h4>\n<p>When an ex is causing arguments between you and your partner, the most important thing you can do is make sure you and your partner are on the same page BEFORE the ex is there. So, sit down now with your partner and make a plan for how the two of you will handle the situation.</p>\n<h4>2. SHARE WITH YOUR PARTNER</h4>\n<p>When you talk about this with your partner, be sure to reveal any hidden emotions you have (especially if this isn’t the core issue you’ve been working on). Nothing can help repair the damage your ex has done like opening up to your partner and letting your partner know that this situation bothers you as well.</p>\n<h4>3. KEEP YOUR PARTNER IN THE LOOP</h4>\n<p>Your partner won’t always be there when you talk with your ex. And your partner will be worried about what happens when he/she isn’t there. So, be up front with your partner about when you’ve said to your ex and what you discussed so it doesn’t feel like you’re hiding something or lying. And don’t fall in to the trap of trying to “protect” your partner by not telling her bad things that happened. If your partner later finds out (and you didn’t tell your partner), that will seriously undermine your partner’s trust in you.</p>\n<h4>4. SET BOUNDARIES</h4>\n<p>Be clear about where the boundaries are with your ex. Certain topics are sacred to your current relationship while others are shared with your ex (like children from the previous relationship). If you find your ex putting his/her nose where it doesn’t belong, politely ask that he/she respect your privacy and the relationship you have with your partner.</p>\n<h3>The Other Partner</h3>\n<p>When your partner is still in contact with his/her ex, you may feel neglected or like you don’t matter as much as your partner’s ex. It might seem that your partner is choosing his/her ex over you, which is very hurtful. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>1. MAKE A PLAN</h4>\n<p>When an ex is causing arguments between you and your partner, the most important thing you can do is make sure you and your partner are on the same page BEFORE the ex is there. So, sit down now with your partner and make a plan for how the two of you will handle the situation. Remember to include in the plan: a) what you will both do – and won’t do – in front of the ex; b) how you both will handle it after the ex leaves.</p>\n<h4>2. CHECK IN</h4>\n<p>Sometimes your partner will forget to keep you in the loop about what is happening with his/her ex. Try to find a non-blaming and non-accusatory way to check in with your partner about his/her ex. Maybe you could check in once a week about any decisions your partner made with his/her ex so you feel in the loop? (If you’re going to do this, this would be a good thing to put in the plan you two develop.)</p>\n<h4>3. OFFER HELP</h4>\n<p>Ask your partner what it is that you can do or change to be helpful, and remember that your support is a huge help to him/her. By asking how you can be involved, your partner will be less likely to feel like you are intruding and you may end up with more input into the situation.</p>\n<h4>4. ASK FOR WHAT YOU NEED</h4>\n<p>Try to express to your partner what you need. Maybe you need more clear communication about when he/she has seen the ex and/or has responsibility for the kids. Or maybe you need some time set aside just for the two of you to spend together. If there are specific topics that you think should be off limits with the ex (like your intimate life) or certain situations that are difficult for you (like spending time with shared friends), let your partner know how he/she can help you navigate those events.</p>\n<h2>THE EX IS A SOURCE OF STRESS FOR BOTH OF US</h2>\n<p>When an ex-partner has a forceful personality or strong opinions – even when both of you in the current relationship are on the same page &#8211; it can be difficult to set effective boundaries.</p>\n<h3>The Partner with an Ex</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, you might get really frustrated with your ex and want your partner to help. But your partner might not step in as much as you’d like. If that’s the case, consider the following tips:</p>\n<h4>1. DISCUSS BOUNDARIES</h4>\n<p>Have a conversation with your partner to decide where and how you are both comfortable with the ex being involved. Once you have a clear list, share this with your ex. Although it might be difficult at first, when expectations are clear people are better able to work together around a shared goal, like parenting the children.</p>\n<h4>2. BE ASSERTIVE</h4>\n<p>There is a difference between being assertive and being bossy, and a big difference between being assertive and being passive (e.g. not directly stating what you want but rather dropping hints). When you are assertive about what you expect from both your partner and your ex, you tell them clearly (in a non-blaming way) how you would like each of them to act. Be willing to hear their sides and compromise, but speaking up is the first step!</p>\n<h4>3. TURN TO YOUR PARTNER</h4>\n<p>Especially if this isn’t the core issue you decided to work on, turn to your partner when you are feeling frustrated with your ex. Opening up and sharing the hidden emotions (fear, frustration, helplessness) can start a great conversation. When you and your partner are on the same page and a team together, you will be better equipped to talk with your ex.</p>\n<h3>The Other Partner</h3>\n<p>When your partner is still in contact with his/her ex, especially when dealing with shared custody, you may feel pulled into their relationship as well, even if it doesn’t feel like your place or this isn’t something you should be doing. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>1. THIS IS HARD FOR ME</h4>\n<p>Sometimes, particular situations are more difficult as an outside partner or as a step-parent. For example, if trading the kids with your partner’s ex is particularly uncomfortable for you, ask your partner if they can handle this without you. Sometimes, staying away from situations that will cause unnecessary fights is the best move you can make.</p>\n<h4>2. KNOW YOUR ROLE</h4>\n<p>When you are a step-parent or part of a blended family, it can be difficult to navigate your relationship both with the children and with their biological parent who isn’t your partner. If you haven’t already or this isn’t your core issue, have a conversation with your partner and his/her ex about your role in the children’s lives. Everyone’s first goal should be providing a healthy and happy home for the kids!</p>\n<h4>3. SUPPORT YOUR PARTNER</h4>\n<p>If you are unhappy with the relationship you and/or your partner has with his/her ex, then this has likely caused fights in the past. Be as supportive of your partner as you can. Offer to help and see what they ask for, be willing to compromise, and make sure your partner knows you are there for him/her and on his/her team.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<h2>Why Intimate Relationships Are Important</h2>\n<p>You’ve probably heard the phrase, “survival of the fittest” before. We live in a world that can feel like one big competition. Whether you’re competing for a spot on a sports team, at your dream school, or for your dream job, you may find yourself facing emotional, physical, mental, and even spiritual challenges. However, many studies prove that if you are in an intimate relationship, those challenges will be easier to face with the support of an intimate partner.</p>\n<p>For example, one study used an MRI to observe how 16 women with and without intimate partners reacted to perceived threats. They were told that if they saw a red X, there was a chance of receiving a small shock to the ankle. If they saw a blue O, there was no chance of receiving a shock. The participants were placed under three separate conditions looking at either red X’s or blue O’s. First, holding the hand of someone they were in an intimate relationship with, while being shown an X or O. The second, while holding the hand of a stranger of the same sex as their partner, while being shown an X or O. The third, not holding anyone’s hand, while being shown an X or O. Once the images of certain brain regions such as the right anterior insula, which responds to perceived threat, were analyzed, it was found that when the women were holding their partner’s hand, their brains were less activated when shown a red X than when holding a stranger’s hand, or no hand at all. It was also found that the happier the women reported they were with their intimate relationships, the less the threat-related regions of their brains activated when they were shown a red X.</p>\n<p>Another study observed 188 couples to determine how being in an intimate relationship affected how one partner coped with having congestive heart failure. The research assistants gave standardized questionnaires and interviewed each partner separately. Then, the couples were videotaped talking about something they disagreed on in their intimate relationship. The tapes were analyzed to differentiate the ratio of positive to negative things the partners said to each other. That data made an index of overall relationship quality which broke down the level of intimacy in each relationship. Researchers then followed public records to determine which patients died over the next 4 years. The study found that the happier the couples were with the intimacy in their relationship, according to the data index, the less likely the partner with congestive heart failure was to die in the 4-year period. How we talk to our intimate partners and how happy we are with our intimate relationships is correlated with our life expectancy, especially with a health problem.</p>\n<h2>Intimate Relationships are Essential to the Human Experience</h2>\n<p>Intimate relationships are a basic feature of who we are as human beings. We all have a nervous system that responds to and equips us not only for intimate social interaction, but to love and be loved. We are biologically attuned to the person we share an intimate bond with. Just like our capacity for language and logic, our capacity for intimacy is a big factor in how we regulate our emotions, how well we understand our partner’s emotions and our emotional intelligence which allows us to not only survive, but thrive in the world we live in. In order to understand the positive and negative aspects of being human, we must work to understand not only birth and death, but conflicts, emotions and intimate relationships.</p>\n<h3><strong>Three Intrinsic Properties of Intimate Relationships:</strong></h3>\n<p>1. They determine the survival of our species<br />\n2. They are a universal human experience<br />\n3. They expand our range of emotional experience</p>\n<h3><strong>Three Extrinsic Properties of Intimate Relationships:</strong></h3>\n<p>1. Intimate relationships affect our mental and physical health<br />\n2. They influence the well-being of children<br />\n3. They form the fabric of society</p>\n<h2>Intimate Relationships Determine the Survival of Our Species</h2>\n<p>The phrase “survival of the fittest” comes from the idea of natural selection in Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution. According to this theory, sometimes random gene changes result in better fitness. Fitness is the chance that offspring will survive and reproduce. Different factors such as intimate relationships determine whether or not a gene or set of genes will improve fitness. The saying “it takes a tribe” is supported by scientific evidence.</p>\n<p>Social interactions, alliances, coalitions, and hierarchies are critical. They can have serious consequences on how successful a family is at surviving and reproducing. The ways we humans attract and select intimate partners, the attachments we make, how willing we are to reproduce, how often we do, and how well we provide for and take care of each other and our children directly and indirectly affect fitness. Interpersonal, and more specifically, intimate relationships play a key role in not only how long we live, but in the quality of the lives we live.</p>\n<h2>The Biology Behind Fairy Tales and Fantasies</h2>\n<p>Magical, is often how we describe an intimate sexual encounter that matches and maybe exceeds what we perceive to be ideal. However, there is biology behind the fairy tales and fantasies. Sexual desires and interactions are the result of a mix of neurochemical events which link physical and psychological reactions to spinal reflexes that arouse the limbic system and sensory cortex, which causes the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland to produce hormones that alter the sensitivity and functioning of our sexual organs.</p>\n<p>MRI scans prove that being in a happy and healthy intimate relationship helps us get through life. They also prove that love is biologically based. They show that our brains react differently when we see a picture of the person we love and are in an intimate relationship with, than when we see a picture of someone we have a close relationship with, or when we see a picture of a stranger.</p>\n<p>MRI scans of participants in a study looking at their intimate partner revealed that the regions of our brain, like the anterior cingulate cortex, medial insula, caudate, and the putamen, which are stimulated when we receive money, and even an intravenous injection of cocaine are also stimulated by the sight of our intimate partners.</p>\n<p>These responses motivate us towards closeness with our intimate partners just as they motivate us to make money. On the other hand, deactivation in these same regions of our brain occur when we are sad, depressed, or receiving critical social judgments.</p>\n<h2>What’s Love Got to Do with It?</h2>\n<p>Sexual desire and romantic love with an intimate partner seem to function as two different biological systems. They both cause the release of an endorphin called oxytocin during intimate physical contact such as a massage or sexual intercourse. Oxytocin serves as a key ingredient in the neurobiological system that promotes feelings of calmness, sociability, and trust. Part of why this happens is, oxytocin reduces activity in fear-related brain structures such as the amygdala and hypothalamus.</p>\n<p>Oxytocin is partly why holding the hand of our intimate partner while facing a perceived threat helps us cope with it, causing our threat-related brain regions to activate less than they would if we faced the perceived threat alone. Biological systems in our bodies respond in systematic ways to what is happening in our intimate relationships.</p>\n<h2>Intimate Relationships are a Universal Human Experience</h2>\n<p>Lasting intimate relationships, often formed with the intention of having children, are found in all societies. One study on 100 industrial and agricultural countries found that more than 90% of all men and women have experienced a type of intimate relationship, like marriage, by the time they are in their late 40’s. Some of these intimate relationships are legally sanctioned like marriages, while others are not.</p>\n<p>One type of intimate relationship that is not legally sanctioned is cohabitation, where intimate partners live together but are not married. Both of these intimate relationships usually involve two people who have an emotional investment in one another. These types of intimate relationships are often motivated by romantic intimacy, or love, and mutual attraction. Stories about intimacy, some fiction, some non-fiction, are passed down generation to generation all over the world. Clear evidence derived from studies of ethnography, neuroscience, folk tales, and even ethology supports romantic love’s universality.</p>\n<p>The need to belong is a fundamental source of motivation for human behavior and this need is commonly met through intimate relationships by stable bonds, frequent contact, and mutual concern. Just because we are designed to love and be loved does not mean that everyone has the same capacity for it.</p>\n<h2>Historical and Cultural Shifts in Intimate Relationships</h2>\n<p>Historical and cultural factors affect how we give and receive intimacy. For example, two intimate partners struggling to make ends meet will have different core issues than two intimate partners that have a high socioeconomic status. The way various cultures frame what intimacy looks like is demonstrated in how love songs vary from one culture to another.</p>\n<p>Young adults in North America and China self-reported very similarly when interviewed on emotions they felt during common experiences, except when it came to love. Young adults in North America framed love as intensely positive and a big contributor to happiness while young adults in China framed love as often being one sided and a big contributor to sadness. Perhaps this is because North America is individualistic and focuses on an individual’s goals over the goals of a group while China does the opposite. The point is, how intimacy is initiated, maintained, and experienced depends on many factors which vary across cultures.</p>\n<h3>Individualistic Intimacy vs Collectivist Intimacy</h3>\n<p>In individualistic cultures, family is not involved in how an intimate partner is selected but it does support the process of finding an intimate partner and gets introduced to the intimate partner by the individual. In collectivist cultures, family often chooses the intimate partner with the goal of improving the family’s financial stability and or social status. Once the family finds a mate they approve of, they introduce the intimate partner to the individual.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Western values have spread. Now, many intimate relationships in collectivist cultures are started by individuals, and not their families. Marriages used to primarily be a type of business transaction between two families, now, marriage is about two individuals who want to move the commitment of their intimate relationship to the next level and centered around intimacy. Intimate relationships have a core structure of emotional and sexual interdependence that is relatable. The differences are because of cultural settings and historical periods. Intimacy is a universal human experience, but not every human experiences it the same way universally.</p>\n<h3>Intimacy Has Changed</h3>\n<p>• Industrialization and bigger cities decreased the demand for extra hands around the house. People stopped having as many kids as they used to.<br />\n• Increased Graphic Mobility decreased the influence parents have on kids.<br />\n• Improved opportunities for Women giving them even more control over who they had intimate relationships and why, regardless of family ties.<br />\n• It’s easier to get a Divorce. More people marry simply because of an intimate relationship that is bringing them personal satisfaction. It is easier to leave a marriage that is not producing the happiness it was expected to, or that it used to, which makes marriage more fragile.<br />\n• Cohabitation is increasing, and the number of people getting married is decreasing.<br />\nContrary to popular belief, cohabitation does not often lead to marriage. Marriage is no longer seen as a prerequisite to having kids.</p>\n<h2>Intimate Relationships Expand Our Range of Emotional Experience</h2>\n<p>The quest for intimacy is often seen the same thing as a quest for love. However, not every intimate relationship has love. Intimacy and love are not synonyms. Love can be found in various relationships that are not intimate such as friendships and parent-child relationships. Intimate relationships are fundamentally emotional because of how diverse and sexually charged they are.</p>\n<p>Emotional experiences are what we look for when we start an intimate relationship, affect us most during one, and what we reflect on once the intimate relationship ends. Love is not easily defined, but it has essential attributes. Different types of love result from different combinations of these attributes, and a lack of certain attributes.</p>\n<h3>The Seven Essential Attributes of Love</h3>\n<p>1. Desire: wanting to be united with a partner, physically and emotionally.<br />\n2. Idealization: Believing the partner is unique and special.<br />\n3. Joy: experiencing strong, positive emotions.<br />\n4. Preoccupation: thinking a lot about the partner and having little control over when.<br />\n5. Proximity: working to maintain or restore physical closeness or emotional contact.<br />\n6. Prioritizing: giving the relationship more importance than other interests and responsibilities.<br />\n7. Caring: experiencing and expressing feelings of empathy and compassion for the partner.</p>\n<h3>Different Types of Love</h3>\n<p>There are two main types of love that pull us into intimate relationships. Use the checklist below to understand the love in your intimate relationship more.</p>\n<p>1. The type of love that comes to mind when people think of intimacy is passionate love. Passionate love is recognized by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Infatuation</li>\n<li>Intense preoccupation with the partner</li>\n<li>Strong sexual longing</li>\n<li>Throes of ecstasy</li>\n<li>Feelings of exhilaration that come from being reunited with an intimate partner</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2. Compassionate love is recognized by similar feelings, but they’re less intense. They’re also enriched by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warm feelings of attachment</li>\n<li>An authentic and enduring bond</li>\n<li>A sense of mutual commitment</li>\n<li>The profound knowledge that you are caring for another person who is in turn caring for you</li>\n<li>Feeling proud of a mate’s accomplishments</li>\n<li>Satisfaction that comes from sharing goals and perspectives intimately</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Intimate Relationships Affect Our Mental and Physical Health</h2>\n<p>Intimate relationships affect how happy we generally are in life; they affect our subjective well-being. Married people report greater happiness than unmarried people who live together, and unmarried people who live together are happier than people who are divorced, separated, or widowed. This shows that relationship status is related to subjective well-being. The perceived quality of a relationship will affect happiness too. For example, a single person without an intimate relationship will be happier than a person in an unhappy intimate relationship.</p>\n<p>Satisfaction with an intimate relationship is a better indicator of subjective well-being than satisfaction with anything else including but not limited to work, money, friends, and health. Getting into or out of an intimate relationship, relationship transitions, is also linked to subjective well-being. When people get married their subjective well-being increases but as they divorce their subjective well-being decreases, and it remains pretty low for the following years.</p>\n<p>Sometimes when challenges arise in intimacy, people lean on substance abuse which often creates health challenges which can make it harder to improve intimacy. Experiments can’t be conducted to prove this as it wouldn’t be ethical. However, the best available evidence shows something about the experience of being married itself has protective benefits. Something about marriage seems to give people a type of protection that is not truly available in cohabiting or single people. People who are in happy, healthy, intimate relationships have more money, more sex, better health, and are happier with their lives.</p>\n<p>There’s an old joke, “What do married and single people have in common?”<br />\n“Each thinks the other is having more sex.”</p>\n<p>It turns out, the single people are right, married people have more sex than people who are cohabiting but not married. No one is sure if the chicken or the egg came first, and we are also not sure if general happiness with intimacy or a good sex life comes first, but clearly, there is an undeniable correlation. Happiness with intimacy does not just help people live longer after a heart attack, it decreases the chance of catching a cold after being exposed to an experimentally administered virus. It takes women in distressed relationships longer to recover from breast cancer, the list goes on. Cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune functioning are all affected by levels of conflict and hostility in intimate relationships. Conflict reduces the number of cytokines in the body, which respond to various health treats.</p>\n<h2>Intimate Relationships Influence the Well-being of Children</h2>\n<p>Babies are cute, cuddly and enter the world with endless potential but are helpless at first. They’re extremely vulnerable, and as a result, dependent. They depend on caregivers for food, shelter, safety, stimulation, and affection. Just as relationship status, relationship quality, and relationship transitions relate to the subjective well-being of people in an intimate relationship, they relate to the well-being of children. In fact, the relationship status of parents is more influential than their race and their education in determining whether their children will experience severe poverty.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nationally representative data in the U.S shows that 81% of children with unmarried parents experience severe poverty, compared with 69% of black children and 63% of children whose head of household had completed less than 12 years of school.</li>\n<li>Compared to biological children of married parents, biological children of cohabiting parents are less engaged in schoolwork and display more emotional and behavioral problems.</li>\n<li>The quality of the intimate relationship parents have is related to children’s emotional security. When there is conflict between parents, children commonly turn to acting out and aggression with their classmates.</li>\n<li>Parental conflict affects a range of biological systems in developing children, compromising their health by reducing their sleep and causing puberty to start earlier.</li>\n<li>Contrary to popular belief, a divorce itself does not negatively affect children as much as the number of relationship transitions do. If the parents’ marriage was full of conflict before the divorce, children can benefit from the divorce.</li>\n<li>The family circumstances children encounter influence how they will manage their own intimate relationships, how much education they will complete, and their parenting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Intimate Relationships Form the Fabric of Society</h2>\n<p>It may be hard to see how our intimate relationships affect anyone outside of our social circles, we may try to keep our intimate relationships private. However, social control theory explains the connection between intimate relationships and the broader social impact of individual’s actions. Petty crime, alcohol, marijuana, and other drug use like cocaine is known to fluctuate with changes in relationship status.</p>\n<p>Factors such as intelligence, personality, poverty, and even parental crime do not explain findings on how likely men are to reduce or stop crime as happy marriages with quality intimacy do. Interdependence in high-quality intimate relationships can encourage partners to guide each other toward socially acceptable lifestyles.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, intimacy ironically is a blessing and a curse. Much of what allows us to enjoy passion and companionship also leave us vulnerable to pain and suffering. Intimacy or the lack thereof brings out the best and worst in us. Love and hate can affect not only our emotional health, but our mental, spiritual, and physical health too. Intimate relationships give the time between dawn and dusk meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<h2>Intimate Relationships Take Work</h2>\n<p>Congratulations on taking initiative and working to improve your intimate relationship. It’s not easy, intimate relationships are complicated. Even Albert Einstein, who solved great mysteries, developed theories such as the theory of relativity, and is commonly known as one of the most intelligent individuals to have lived, had trouble with his interpersonal relationships. He admitted to failing at being a husband with his first and second wife, and to having an extremely difficult time being a father. Einstein’s eldest son once said, “Probably the only project he ever gave up on was me.” Some of Einstein’s conditions for his first wife were for her to not expect intimacy from him, stop talking to him if he requested, and to immediately leave his bedroom or study at his request. Don’t feel crushed by how tough the challenges in your relationship may feel, instead, focus on what you can do to help improve the intimacy in your relationship.</p>\n<h2>Interdependence is Key</h2>\n<p>Intimate relationships involve the personalities, feelings, passions, and goals of two people. As a result, intimate relationships are challenging, but desirable and enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Take a moment to ask yourself if your relationship meets the four criteria which define an intimate relationship:</p>\n<p><em><strong>1. Bidirectional interdependence</strong></em><br />\nDo you rely on each other?</p>\n<p><em><strong>2. Considering each other special and unique</strong></em><br />\nDo you think you could easily replace your partner?<br />\nWhat makes them special?<br />\nDo they make you feel replaceable?<br />\nWhat does your partner think makes you special?</p>\n<p><em><strong>3. Influence each other across a variety of domains</strong></em><br />\nDo you consider your partner when making a decision?<br />\nDoes your partner consider you when making a decision?</p>\n<p><em><strong>4. Experience some degree of mutual sexual passion</strong></em><br />\nHow often do you want to be physically intimate with your partner?<br />\nHow often does your partner want to be physically intimate with you?<br />\nAre you both happy with your sex life?</p>\n<p>It’s shared experiences and continuous interactions that keep people from being strangers even after they haven’t seen each other in a while. The closeness of a relationship is demonstrated in how strong and frequent the various influences partners have over each other are.</p>\n<h2>Turning Impersonal Relationships into Personal Relationships</h2>\n<p>Interdependence is key, but not the only key ingredient for a personal relationship. There is interdependence between a teacher and a student, a company manager and an employee, a doctor, and a patient. You cannot have intimacy without interdependence but just because you have an interdependent relationship does not mean you have an intimate relationship. Two individuals looking to turn their impersonal relationship more personal need more than interdependence. Impersonal relationships are task-oriented and tend to be formal. Personal relationships tend to be informal and allow for deeper emotional connections. In order for an impersonal relationship to become a personal relationship, it requires interdependence and mutual admiration between two people. Two people that identify and like the unique qualities in each other and do not believe they can easily replace each other. Often the value we place in a relationship can be measured by how we would be affected and how we would react to losing that person. Losing a parent is different than losing an acquaintance.</p>\n<h2>Personal Relationships versus Close Relationships</h2>\n<p>The words personal and close are similar but not all personal relationships are close. Some relationships that are interdependent, and people treat each other as unique, irreplaceable individuals, but how close they are varies. For example, the relationship between an aunt and a niece is different than the relationship between a boyfriend and girlfriend.</p>\n<h2>Close Relationships versus Intimate Relationships</h2>\n<p>Closeness is crucial, but not the final ingredient missing from the ingredients we’ve discussed will cook up an intimate relationship. Compare and contrast your intimate relationship with your relationship with family members, friends, and coworkers. If you would like, you can make a list and reflect on what those similarities and differences are between those relationships.</p>\n<h2>One-Night Stands</h2>\n<p>Having sex outside of close relationships, having hookups without strong and frequent interdependence does not make the cut for an intimate relationship. Just because two people are physically intimate does not mean that they have an intimate relationship. However, the possibility for a close relationship resulting in physical intimacy does take a close relationship to the next level, it makes it intimate. Even unhappy couples with strong interdependence that may result in physical intimacy are considered to be in an intimate relationship even though it is not a happy one. An unhappy relationship is different than a happy relationship, but both are considered intimate relationships.</p>\n<h2>The Next Level</h2>\n<p>Taking a close relationship to the next level doesn’t necessarily mean that specific close relationship will become romantically intimate. Both best friends and significant others hold a closer place to our hearts than other relationships with less intimacy. However, remember that the relationship also needs to be set apart according to how interdependent it is, and how frequent various interactions happen between the two.</p>\n<p>Take a moment and reflect on the differences between your close friends, best friends, family friends, family members, and intimate partners. Think about the differences in your view of each relationship and how for example, having a conflict with a close friend affects you differently than having a conflict with an intimate partner does.</p>\n<p>An easily distinguishable difference between any close relationship and an intimate relationship is whether or not both partners feel sexual tension. That’s an easy way to evaluate if a close relationship has been taken to the next level, that it has become more intimate than other close relationships. Regardless of whether or not any “moves” will be made, the potential to engage in sexual intercourse exists in the minds of both people involved. Once a lustful, sexual, passionate vibe is present and the possibility of having sex exists, a close relationship becomes an intimate relationship.</p>\n<h2>Intimacy Check</h2>\n<p>A simplified way to determine if you have an intimate relationship with your partner is to ask yourself if the following is true about you and your partner:</p>\n<p>1. Do your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors frequently affect each other?<br />\n2. Are you both happy with how frequently you see each other?<br />\n3. Do you both text each other when you don’t see each other as often as you would both like to?<br />\n4. Do you enjoy activities such as studying, cuddling, eating, or going out together?<br />\n5. Do you feel sad when your partner feels sad? Do they feel sad when you feel sad?<br />\n6. Do you feel happy when your partner feels happy? Does your partner feel happy when you feel happy?<br />\n7. Is physical intimacy a possibility in your relationship?</p>\n<h2>Relationship Category Breakdown</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>An interdependent relationship is one where the behavior of one partner affects the other.</li>\n<li>A personal relationship is one where partners consider each other to be irreplaceable.</li>\n<li>A close relationship is one where partners have a strong and frequent influence on each other.</li>\n<li>An intimate relationship is one where mutual sexual tension exists, and partners may share and express sexual feelings for each other, possibly resulting in physical intimacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Do you and your partner have difficulties because one or both of you feel emotionally unsupported? Or do one of you struggle with “being there” for your partner when he/she is upset or feeling down? If so, this activity should help.</p>\n<p>People differ in how they want to be supported and problems arise when one partner does not meet the needs or expectations of the other. For example, a partner more in tune with feelings may share emotions when looking for support; however, if the other partner is not as emotional, he/she may respond in a way that feels unsupported, invalidated, or dismissed. These issues often create the following cycles: &#8220;I Am Not Overreacting!&#8221; and &#8220;I Need You to Listen, Not Fix it!&#8221;</p>\n<h2><u>I AM NOT OVERREACTING</u></h2>\n<p>In this cycle, partners may differ on emotional expressiveness, reactivity, or sensitivity. One partner may feel unsupported when he/she seeks emotional support and the other partner responds in a way that feels invalidating such as by saying, “oh, that’s not a big deal” or by refusing to talk to the partner until he/she “calms down”. This can cause a lot of hurt, sadness, and resentment.<br />\nThe partner who is less emotionally reactive or expressive may not understand why his/her partner is upset and may feel attacked when his/her partner accuses him/her of not caring. However, he/she may not understand why something is a big deal and may feel he/she is helping when he/she tells the partner to “relax”. This can often lead to frustration and both partners feeling misunderstood.</p>\n<h2><em>The Partner Who Feels Emotionally Unsupported</em></h2>\n<p>Although you used to turn to your partner for emotional support, over time you’ve learned that your partner likely won’t be there for you in the way you want. As a result, you may get very upset when your partner doesn’t support you, react with surface emotions such as anger or frustration, or eventually open up less to your partner. Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<h3>1. REMEMBER NATURAL DIFFERENCES</h3>\n<p>Remember your DEEP Understanding and consider how each of the DEEP components could be contributing to both your and your partner’s feelings. You and your partner likely have natural differences in emotionally expressiveness and/or sensitivity. Remember, your partner isn’t trying to be unsupportive. When your partner does not respond in the way you need, try not to respond with anger, frustration, or other surface emotions that could make your partner react. Instead, talk with your partner and give him/her some tips on how he/she could respond in ways that would make you feel more supported.</p>\n<h3>2 STRENGTHEN YOUR RELATIONSHIP</h3>\n<p>Because you feel unsupported, you likely also feel disconnected from your partner. Therefore, one suggestion is to increase intimacy in other domains. For example, if you both are comfortable with touch, consider cuddling, hugs, or even sex as a way to feel more connected. Other suggestions include prioritizing date nights or planning to do something fun together at least once a week such as doing a physical activity, cooking together, playing a game, or watching TV.</p>\n<h3>3. OTHER TYPES OF SUPPORT</h3>\n<p>Try to recognize the ways your partner does support you (e.g., financially, helping around the house, supportive of career or school, etc.) By not dismissing these other types of support as valid, you are more likely to be less biased in how you view your partner and are more likely to feel supported, even if your partner is not as sensitive or emotional.</p>\n<h3>4. CAN SOMEONE ELSE PROVIDE SUPPORT?</h3>\n<p>While you certainly don’t want to shut your partner out and not share any of your feelings, it may be that a friend or family member is going to be more naturally supportive. If you know that your partner “just doesn’t get” why you’re upset about a particular topic, consider talking with someone else instead. In this case, acceptance of natural differences may be your best solution.</p>\n<h2><em>The Partner Who is Told He/She is Emotionally Unsupportive</em></h2>\n<p>After hearing over and over how insensitive or unsupportive you are, you may feel frustrated and hurt. You may also feel stuck because you don’t know how to make things better or like you are being punished for not being as emotional. These feelings may make you pull away from your partner or respond very defensively. Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<h3>1. BE A GOOD LISTENER</h3>\n<p>Being a supportive and validating partner starts with being a good listener. Often, your partner just wants to share what he/she is feeling with you. So, when your partner tells you something, do not just respond with opinions, judgments, or requests to calm down. Give him or her the time to express feelings. Also, use body language to show that you are listening. It is important that you make eye contact, turn your body towards them, and stop whatever you are doing.</p>\n<h3>2 THE KEY TO LISTENING</h3>\n<p>You can recognize your partner’s feelings as valid without agreeing with him/her. Therefore, do not respond with statements that undermine your partner’s feelings like “It’s not a big deal” or “You’re overreacting”. Instead, summarize his/her feelings to show understanding. Try to say things like, “I can tell you’re feeling really upset, frustrated, hurt, etc.” or “It sounds like that situation was really hard for you.” Remember, your partner is entitled to his/her feelings just as you are. By responding in a way that summarizes your partner’s feelings, your partner will feel heard and supported.</p>\n<h3>3. ASK WHAT YOUR PARTNER NEEDS</h3>\n<p>At a time when your partner is NOT upset, have a conversation about what you could do when he/she is upset that would feel good to your partner. Your partner might have some very simple ideas that would help.</p>\n<h2><u>I NEED YOU TO LISTEN, NOT FIX IT</u></h2>\n<p>Here, one partner may feel unheard and unsupported when he/she seeks support and the other partner starts problem solving or tries to “fix it” instead of listening. This can cause feelings of invalidation, hurt, sadness, and loneliness.The partner whose first instinct to try to help their partner solve the problem may feel annoyed or frustrated because it may feel like the partner “must enjoy being upset” if the partner doesn’t want to fix the problem. So, while he/she initially felt the desire to help the partner, he/she eventually tunes out the partner because he/she feels powerless to change the partner’s situation.</p>\n<h2><em>The Expressive Partner </em></h2>\n<p>You may feel hurt or frustrated when you are turning to your partner for emotional support and he/she responds with problem solving. This can leave you feeling like he/she doesn’t care for your needs. Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<h3>1. EXPECTATIONS</h3>\n<p>Are there any ways in which your partner does provide support? Are there sometimes when your partner’s problem solving is helpful? This is an important question because when you are upset about something, you are more likely to focus on what your partner is NOT doing to your satisfaction instead of focusing on when his/her response to “fix it” is helpful. By asking yourself this question every day, you’re more likely to notice and appreciate when your partner is meeting your needs. If you&#8217;re still feel you need more support, use the problem solving activity in the 4th phase to identify other ways he/she can provide the support you need.</p>\n<h3>2. SPEAKER SKILLS APPLY</h3>\n<p>Whenever you share your frustrations with your partner or ask him/her for more help, remember your Speaker Skills. Make sure to watch your tone of voice and not use blaming language. As much as you want him/her to respond to your emotional needs in a certain way, communicating often in a more demanding way will likely result in him/her pulling away and you not getting your desired outcome.</p>\n<h3>3. TELL PARTNER WHAT YOU WANT</h3>\n<p>If you know your partner has a tendency to jump right into problem solving, start the conversation saying something like “I’m really upset and I just need you to listen to me for a few minutes, okay?” That can help your partner get into the right mindset.</p>\n<h3>4. USE THE SPEAKER/LISTENER STRUCTURE</h3>\n<p>While you certainly don’t want to use it for every conversation, if you’ve repeatedly tried to talk with your partner about a particular topic and he/she just doesn’t listen, consider using the speaker/listener structure. In fact, we have an activity in the Strengthen phase of this program that will allow you to have a speaker/listener conversation about anything you want.</p>\n<h2><em>The Problem Solving Partner</em></h2>\n<p>If your partner reacts negatively to your problem solving, you may feel frustrated because your partner does not recognize you are trying to help. Additionally, you may not know how to provide support in the way your partner wants which leaves you feeling sad and/or annoyed. Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<h3>1. ACTIVE LISTENING</h3>\n<p>It may come more naturally for you to jump into problem solving when your partner expresses him/herself, but that can often feel invalidating to your partner when he/she just wants you to listen. Show you are listening by asking questions.</p>\n<h3>2. REMEMBER YOUR LISTENER TIPS</h3>\n<p>Practice how to be a good listener: a) summarize; b) don’t defend or justify; and c) don’t jump in right away. Try practicing these skills in addition to not telling your partner what to do.</p>\n<h3>3. ASK HOW YOU CAN BE HELPFUL</h3>\n<p>If you are unsure if your partner wants advice, ask “are you coming to me for advice or do you want me to listen?” The fact you are asking your partner for his/her needs will help him/her feel supported.</p>\n<h3>4. NATURAL DIFFERENCES</h3>\n<p>Remember your DEEP Understanding and consider how each of the DEEP components could be contributing to both your and your partner’s feelings. You and your partner likely have natural differences in emotionally expressiveness.

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>If you and your partner are struggling with trust, it can be upsetting and difficult. When one partner suspects the other partner can’t trust him/her, there are two main situations: &#8220;I Didn’t Do Anything!&#8221; or &#8220;I’m Hiding Something&#8221;.</p>\n<h2>I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING!</h2>\n<p>If your partner doesn’t trust you and you haven’t given him/her any reason to feel that way, it can make you feel frustrated and exhausted by an uphill battle you didn’t start. If so, consider the following tips:</p>\n<h3>1. SHARE MORE WITH YOUR PARTNER</h3>\n<p>Even if you haven’t done something objectively wrong, if your partner doesn’t feel like they can trust you this will degrade the relationship. Sometimes this comes from different levels of comfort with sharing. If you wouldn’t normally talk about issues related to your partner’s suspicions but wouldn’t mind sharing, giving your partner more information might be helpful. For example, if your partner is worried you’re cheating on him/her, sharing more about who you saw during the day or where you went would be helpful. If your partner feels in the loop, he/she is less likely to be caught off guard and feel mistrustful.</p>\n<h3>2. CONSIDER HIDDEN EMOTIONS AND PAST EXPERIENCES</h3>\n<p>While what you see (your partner’s hidden emotion) is likely anger or constant questioning, the likely hidden emotion is fear – of you ending the relationship, of being taken advantage of, or of something bad happening. And these hidden emotions are often caused by previous experiences. For example, was your partner cheated on in the past or did he/she grow up in a household where there weren’t any stable relationships? If you haven’t talked about these issues, try using the speaker/listener activity in the Strengthen phase to get your partner to open up. The more you know, the more accepting you’ll likely be of your partner’s behavior.</p>\n<h3>3. ARE YOU WILLING TO BE TESTED?</h3>\n<p>This is going to sound like an odd suggestion at first, but hear us out! One of the best ways to earn your partner’s trust is to set up an experiment. For example, you and your partner could agree that he/she could “test” you three times in the next couple of weeks or months. For example, he/she could ask you to prove where you are (or where you’ve been) or show receipts for how you’ve spent money. If you’re actually not doing what your partner is worried about, getting some proof of that can be helpful to your partner. On the other hand, knowing that these tests won’t continue forever (it’s only a few times over a period of not more than a few months) can give you confidence that things will get back to normal eventually.</p>\n<h2>I’M HIDING SOMETHING</h2>\n<p>If you are in fact hiding something from your partner, whether it be a credit card charge or an affair, deciding to come clean can be difficult. You may feel caught in the lies that you’ve told and feel that it is too late to come clean to your partner; you might risk losing the relationship. However, the weight, burden, and upkeep of these lies will only continue to grow with time. Consider the following tips:</p>\n<h3>1. BE TRUTHFUL</h3>\n<p>The first step to untangling the web of lies is to be honest with your partner. Although it will likely be a difficult conversation, it is also the first step towards rebuilding trust in your relationship.</p>\n<h3>2. COMMIT TO HONESTY</h3>\n<p>Although you cannot change how you handled difficult topics in the past, you can commit to being honest in the future. It may be hard at first and you and your partner may need to practice your speaker / listener skills during these conversations; however, you partner will notice your effort and likely appreciate it.</p>\n<h3>3. SET YOURSELF UP WELL</h3>\n<p>If particular situations, friends, or events make you more prone to acting in a way that you would lie to your partner about later, consider removing some of those negative influences from your life. While not all can be fully removed, at least limiting your contact can be helpful. Set a plan and let your partner know about it so he/she can know you’re serious about changing your behavior.</p>\n<h3>4. DON’T PUSH YOUR PARTNER TO FORGIVE</h3>\n<p>It’s going to be hard for your partner to find out the truth – especially if you’ve been covering it up for a while. You’ve broken your partner’s trust and it will take time for that to heal. Recognize that, even if your partner wants to forgive you, emotional wounds take time to heal just like physical wounds. It would be naive for your partner to trust you again immediately – you’re going to have to earn it back over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Are one or both of you a member of the military? Do frequent separations due to deployment or job duties cause you to feel disconnected or make it hard to be a team once you are together again? Do you have difficulty communicating with one another due to being away from each other or not being able to discuss work? Have you had to deal with frequent moves or living away from your biggest support system? If so, this post will help you identify how to address these concerns.</p>\n<p>Being a military couple comes with its own unique challenges and sacrifices. You may have to go days, weeks, or months without seeing each other and/or be separated from your closest friends and family. You may also find it hard to stay emotionally connected with each other. Additionally, when one of you returns from deployment, re-integration back into your day-to-day life and routine can be challenging and can be made more difficult by the onset of mental health issues that arose from service. These issues often create the following cycles: &#8220;Day-to-Day Problems&#8221; and &#8220;Issues Around Deployment&#8221;</p>\n<h2>DAY TO DAY PROBLEMS</h2>\n<p>If only one of you is in the military or if you are in two different positions within the military, you may feel hurt when your partner cannot talk about all aspects of his/her job or feel alone when your partner needs to work long hours. If you are the only member of the couple in the military, you may feel guilty that your work takes you away from your family or upset that your partner does not understand the sacrifices you make.</p>\n<h3>The Military Member</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, you might get really frustrated with your partner for not understanding the nature of your work or you may feel guilty that your work gets in the way of the relationship. Tips to change these situation:</p>\n<h4>1. COMMUNICATE</h4>\n<p>Have a conversation with your partner to tell him/her why being in the military is important to you and why you don’t want it to affect your relationship negatively. Ask your partner to share his/her feelings too. Remember your DEEP Understanding and consider how each of the DEEP components could be contributing to both you and your partner’s feelings. Use the Respond conversation to discuss what you can change in how you prioritize your relationship so that the negative impact of your work is lessened.</p>\n<h4>2. STRENGTHEN YOUR RELATIONSHIP</h4>\n<p>Even if you are busy or cannot be open about your work, there are other ways to feel connected with your partner. Decide to prioritize date nights every once in a while or plan to do something fun together at least once a week such as doing a physical activity, cooking together, playing a game, or watching TV.</p>\n<h4>3. RELY ON SUPPORT SYSTEMS</h4>\n<p>Often being in the military can mean living away from friends and family. Recognize that this may be difficult for your partner who moved to support your line of work. Together, try to identify a few people who live close by who you can rely on for support and/or prioritize calling both of your and your partner’s friends and family members more regularly so that you both feel supported.</p>\n<h3>The Non-Military Member</h3>\n<p>If your partner cannot open up about his/her job or is gone frequently due to long hours, you may felt left behind and alone.Tips change these situations:</p>\n<h4>1. THIS IS HARD FOR ME</h4>\n<p>Sometimes, being the non-military member can be filled with loneliness. Especially if this isn’t the core issue you decided to work on, be vulnerable with your partner about how this is hard. Use your DEEP Understanding to better understand why you are feeling the way you are and how it impacts your and your partner’s perspectives. Remember, sharing your hidden emotions can make your partner less likely to be defensive and more likely for the conversation to go smoother.</p>\n<h4>2. RELY ON SUPPORT SYSTEMS</h4>\n<p>Because you are in a military couple, you may be living away from your closest support systems such as family and friends. With your partner’s long hours and possible frequent deployments, this can make you feel isolated from those you love and from a community. Rely on the support of other military spouses who know the challenges you face and when your partner is around, try to integrate those individuals in your lives. As a couple, try to prioritize calling both of your and your partner’s family members and friends so that you can be integrated in their lives and feel more connected as a couple.</p>\n<h2>ISSUES AROUND DEPLOYMENT</h2>\n<p>Deployment can make it hard on both members of the couple to feel connected. Different time zones can make it hard to talk or responsibilities can lead to going days without talking. After deployment, it can be really hard for the person who just returned to feel like a contributing member of the family. He/she may feel isolated from the other partner or could be suffering from mental health concerns as a result of deployment. The partner who was not deployed may want to help, but not know how or could feel confused about having gotten used to a new routine while their partner was away.</p>\n<h3>The Deployed Partner</h3>\n<p>Deployment creates a physical – and often emotional – distance between partners. You may feel distant from your partner during and after your deployment but not know how to make the relationship closer or get the connection back once the deployment ends. Finally, emotional concerns that arose from deployment can make you feel numb or unable to connect to your partner or to your other loved ones. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>1. SET EXPECTATIONS FOR COMMUNICATION DURING DEPLOYMENT</h4>\n<p>If your deployment is coming up, use the Respond Conversation to set expectations for how communication will look during deployment. Consider writing each other letters and/or emails so you can stay connected despite not being able to talk regularly. Talk to each other about how you can keep the communication positive which will help you feel like home life is stable so you can concentrate on your important dangerous work.</p>\n<h4>2. STAY CONNECTED</h4>\n<p>Read the Long Distance Relationship Topic for ideas on how to stay connected despite being far away from each other. Ideas include playing games online, spending quality time together while talking, and strengthening communication. Other ideas include sharing music or listening to a favorite song together, writing letters, or sharing a journal with one another.</p>\n<h4>3. REINTEGRATION</h4>\n<p>Transitioning back home can be challenging. You may be struggling with mental health concerns or emotional problems when you return, which is a very common experience for service members.If so, consider utilizing the free services at your local Military or VA facilities to help you manage the internal struggles you may be facing.</p>\n<h3>The Partner Left Behind</h3>\n<p>As the person left behind, you may feel lonely, hopeless, scared, or any number of difficult emotions about your partner being away. You may really miss him/her while also feeling resentment that he/she chose work over the family. All of those complex feelings make adjustment after deployment more difficult. Additionally, you may not know what to do if your partner returns home with mental health concerns such as PTSD or depression. Tips change these situations:</p>\n<h4><strong>1. SET EXPECTATIONS FOR COMMUNICATION DURING DEPLOYMENT</strong></h4>\n<p>Use the Respond Conversation to set expectations for how communication will look during deployment. Consider writing each other letters and/or emails so you can stay connected despite not being able to talk regularly. Talk to each other about how you can keep the communication positive so that you feel less stressed as the partner left behind and feel joyful in your day to day life despite your partner being away.</p>\n<h4><strong>2. STAY CONNECTED WITH YOUR PARTNER AND YOUR SUPPORT SYSTEM</strong></h4>\n<p>As a couple, it is important to feel emotionally close, despite the distance and sensitive nature of the relationship. Use the tips in the Long Distance Relationship topic to keep this connection alive. Additionally, to feel connected to your community, make sure to access the many military resources available to you (found here) and rely on other spouses who are also dealing with the hardships of deployment</p>\n<h4>3. AFTER DEPLOYMENT</h4>\n<p>For tips on reintegration, click here. Remember, adjustment takes a while and that is ok. If this isn’t the core issue you’re working on, it may be helpful to use the problem solving activity in the Strengthen phase to make a plan for how you can each contribute to a smooth transition back with set expectations for communication, shared house work, and day-today decision making.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Do you and your partner have arguments over parenting? Or maybe you or your partner have children from previous relationships? Is agreeing on ways to parent kids and step-kids difficult for you? If so, this post will help you identify common problems and get some ideas on how to solve them.</p>\n<h2><strong>Issues around parenting can have many forms – which fits you and your relationship?</strong></h2>\n<p>When partners have different views on parenting or different styles, it can create conflict. Additionally, in blended families, families made up of parents, step-parents, kids, and step-kids who come together to make a new family unit, the opinions of outside parents and interactions with current partners can become heated. Often, navigating all the people and opinions that surround parenting can cause significant problems for relationships.</p>\n<h3>GOOD COP / BAD COP</h3>\n<p>One partner may feel that his/her partner is too strict with the children and that his/her own opinion on how to raise the children isn’t heard or taken into consideration. Or one partner could feel unfairly responsible for all the discipline in the household or judged for his/her parenting style.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Strict Parent</strong></h4>\n<p>The more your partner pushes you to lighten up on the kids and have fewer rules, the more you feel the children need structure and discipline. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. KID GOALS </strong></p>\n<p>Sit down with your partner and discuss what your goals are for parenting the children. Make a list of rules together that you can both agree on. This will likely involve some compromise!</p>\n<p><strong>2. SHARE THE DECISION-MAKING</strong></p>\n<p>Try not to criticize your partner or dismiss his/her ideas. Each parent should have a say in the final decision and rules. So, think about the issues you feel really strongly about and maybe let your partner decide some of the other things.</p>\n<p><strong>3. PARENTING BOOKS</strong></p>\n<p>Would reading a book on parenting be an option? Below are several great choices that you and your partner could read together.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Easy-going Parent</strong></h4>\n<p>The more alone you feel in your opinion and frustrated that your partner is hard on the children, the less you feel you have a say in the decisions regarding discipline. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. BE A TEAM</strong></p>\n<p>Do your best to back up your partner in front of the kids. If you disagree about something, try to handle it in advance or after it has happened – somewhere out of earshot of the kids. If the children know the two of you don’t agree, that could create more problems down the road.</p>\n<p><strong>2. SHARE YOUR SIDE</strong></p>\n<p>Try to explain to your partner why you disagree with their parenting style rather than calling it ‘wrong’ or ‘mean’. What are you worried will happen if your partner continues to parent in this way? Do you have any past experiences or emotions that are triggered in these situations? Try framing your thoughts like a DEEP understanding to share with your partner.</p>\n<p><strong>3. BE SPECIFIC</strong></p>\n<p>Do your best to figure out what specifically you would like to see change. Is it the form of discipline (spanking vs time out), expectations for the children, or tone of voice when interacting with the kids?</p>\n<p><strong>4. PARENTING BOOKS</strong></p>\n<p>We learn most of what we know about parenting from experience and observation, but there are lots of other good resources out there, too! Check out some of the options below.</p>\n<h3>YOUR KIDS VS OUR KIDS</h3>\n<p>Partners may not agree on the rules for children or one partner may feel uncomfortable disciplining the other partner’s children.</p>\n<h4>The Non-Biological Parent</h4>\n<p>The more your partner pushes you to become involved with his/her children, the less you want to help. Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<p><strong>1. FUN TIMES</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re struggling to connect with the children, you could set up an activity that you feel confident the whole family will enjoy, especially your partner’s children. Maybe spending time together at the park or at a school function would be an option. This could help by allowing you to feel more comfortable with the children by starting with fun activity.</p>\n<p><strong>2. ROLES</strong></p>\n<p>Discuss with your partner what your role should be with the kids. Does he/she want you to be involved in rule setting and discipline? If so, find a time to decide on what the rules are so you’re not disagreeing about them in front of the kids. Having these conversations early on can help prevent misunderstandings and arguments later. On the flip side, there may be topics or situations where your partner doesn’t want you involved. Getting clarity about what these situations are so you can respect his/her decisions is key.</p>\n<p><strong>3. WORK TOGETHER</strong></p>\n<p>Work with your partner to create a list of tasks or activities that involve the children and find some for you to do. Maybe you could get the kids breakfast in the morning or help check homework after school? Dividing the time when either you or your partner is responsible or in charge keeps both partners involved as parents.</p>\n<p><strong>4. PARENTING BOOKS</strong></p>\n<p>If you don’t have children of your own, you may not feel very comfortable being a parent to your partner’s kids. Or, you could be looking for more ideas how to help. Would reading a parenting book be an option for you? If so, see the ideas below!</p>\n<h4>The Biological Parent</h4>\n<p>The more alone you feel as a parent, the harder it is to express your frustration to your partner in a productive way. Alternately, if you feel your partner is overstepping, finding a way to create balance without shutting him/her out completely can be challenging.</p>\n<p>Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<p><strong>1. ASK “WHY?”</strong></p>\n<p>Ask your partner why he/she isn’t more involved or why he/she is so interested in helping out. Is there something about how he/she raised that is related to how he/she is acting now? Does he/she feel uncomfortable asserting authority over kids who aren’t his/her own? Does he/she feel left out when not involved in parenting?</p>\n<p><strong>2. BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT</strong></p>\n<p>Try to tell your partner specifically what you need. For example, you might want help with watching the kids or support from your partner when you discipline the kids. If you can identify specific changes you want your partner to make, those can be really good things to discuss as part of your “Respond” conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>3.  … AND ABOUT WHAT YOU DON’T WANT</strong></p>\n<p>If your partner is doing things that you wish he/she wouldn’t, that can also be helpful for your partner to hear. But if you’re going to include something like this in the “Respond” conversation, try to also include something you DO want him/her to do.</p>\n<p><strong>4.

      "rendered": "<p>Are you or your partner currently in school or job training? Or are either of you thinking about going back to school or seeking additional job training? If so, this post will help you identify common problems and get some ideas on how to solve them.</p>\n<h2>Issues around School and Job Training can have many forms – which fits your relationship?</h2>\n<p>External Stressors, such as going back to school or seeking additional job training, can cause significant problems for relationships: <strong>&#8220;Now now&#8221;</strong> and <strong>&#8220;This Balancing Act Is Killing Me&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Below are common cycles couples experience around external stressors such as school or job training as well as tips for breaking out of these cycles. Because every couple is different, it’s important to read through each cycle. You might find that more than one applies to you or your partner’s behavior.</p>\n<h3>NOT NOW!</h3>\n<p>Partners may not agree on how important the advanced education or training is or whether the timing is right. If one partner already has a degree or advanced training, seeking further education may seem excessive or unnecessary.</p>\n<h4>The Partner Wanting School/Training</h4>\n<p>You may feel caught between wanting to advance your career and contributing to your relationship right now. It might seem that this investment in yourself may not pay off in the long run. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. OPEN UP</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re feeling really certain you want to go to classes/training despite the barriers, there are likely some strong emotions you’re feeling – be sure to share these hidden emotions with your partner. For example, you might be feeling unappreciated at your current job or like you’re letting yourself / your family down by staying in your current position. If this isn’t your core issue, we suggest you first do the Speaker-Listener conversation in the Strengthen Phase before doing the Problem-Solving conversation activity (also in the Strengthen Phase). If this IS your core issue, then you’ll already follow this pattern.</p>\n<p><strong>2. ASK YOUR PARTNER</strong></p>\n<p>Chances are, if this has become a problem in your relationship, your partner likely has some strong emotions as well. You may be aware of some but not others. So, be sure to ask about your partner’s feelings! If this is hard for you, consider using the Speaker-Listener activity in the Strengthen phase of the program.</p>\n<p><strong>3. PRO CON LIST</strong></p>\n<p>Together with your partner, create a pro/con list about going back to school / getting additional training. You may find that doing this together gets you and your partner on the same page – regardless of the decision. For example, ask: What does tuition cost? Have you saved for tuition? How long would it take to pay back loans? What is job availability like out of school? How much income will you be giving up in order to attend school / training? If this isn’t your core issue, we suggest you use the Problem-Solving conversation in the Strengthen phase of the program.</p>\n<p><strong>4. CONSIDER ALL THE OPTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes our first idea isn’t the best one. Consider:<br />\n• Could you go to school part time? Although it may extend the time of the degree, working part time during school could help offset some of the financial burden on your partner.<br />\n• Could you find an option that would cost less money or take less time? There are a lot of resources online that can help you find free / low-cost training in your area.<br />\n• Are there extended family members that could help out during this period (e.g., with childcare or money)?</p>\n<h4>The Partner Against School/Training</h4>\n<p>School and job training are sometimes seen as a luxury, one that may feel outside of your financial or time capabilities right now. Or, you may not see the need for additional education/training if your partner already has a good job. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. TALK IT OUT</strong></p>\n<p>You probably know by now that we’re big fans of making sure you understand a problem before you try to solve it. If this is a core issue you’ve been working on in the program, you’ve already developed a DEEP understanding. If not, consider using the optional activities in the Strengthen phase to develop a DEEP understanding of this issue. At a minimum, use the optional Speaker-Listener activity in the Strengthen phase to make sure you both share your hidden emotions around this issue.</p>\n<p><strong>2. MAKE A PLAN</strong></p>\n<p>When your partner wants to make this kind of big change, it can feel pretty scary! Try making a long term plan of what school or job training would look like so you have a better idea of what is involved and less is unknown. When are bills due? What major deadlines will your partner have to meet? When are exams? Getting a better idea of when the stressful or “crunch times” are could help you both plan accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>3. RELATIONSHIP GOALS</strong></p>\n<p>Consider sitting down with your partner to jointly discuss what your goals are together for the relationship. Do you want kids? Do you want to travel more? Do you want to move? You can then together discuss whether your partner’s goal for training/ education in line with these relationship goals.</p>\n<p><strong>4. CONSIDER ALL THE OPTIONS </strong></p>\n<p>If your concern has to do with the type of training / education your partner is considering, take a look online to help your partner locate other possibilities for training or education in your area. There may be options (e.g., free, part-time) that would reduce some of your concerns.</p>\n<h3>THIS BALANCING ACT IS KILLING ME!</h3>\n<p>When one partner is in school or seeking further job training, the other partner is also affected. Figuring out together how to handle these extra stressors can be challenging.</p>\n<h4>The Partner In School/Training</h4>\n<p>You may feel overworked trying to do training, keep your relationship strong, take care of kids, maintain friendships, and somewhere find some time for yourself! This is when you most need your partner there for you. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. NOW VS LATER</strong></p>\n<p>Try to prioritize what has to be done now versus what can wait. Assignments for school/training, taking care of the kids, and paying bills are “now” tasks. Even though other things on your plate feel important, ask yourself if they are really priorities.</p>\n<p><strong>2. DIVIDE AND CONQUER</strong></p>\n<p>Sit down with your partner and make a chore list to decide who does what. Figuring out what works with your schedule so you can help with while in school could help ease the weight on your partner. Also, be sure to figure out which times during the day (or which specific tasks) your partner really needs your help. Knowing that can help you make sure you don’t let your partner down when he/she needs you most.</p>\n<p><strong>3. SAY THANKS</strong></p>\n<p>Recognize that when you are in school your partner is picking up extra responsibilities so that you’re able to focus on school/training. Find a way to thank him/her and show your appreciation for all they are doing.</p>\n<h4>The Partner Supporting</h4>\n<p>When your partner is in school or training, extra burden falls to you. This may be financially, childcare, or responsibilities at home like housework and paying bills. It might feel like you are working harder than your partner who is getting the degree! Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. NOW VS LATER</strong></p>\n<p>Try to prioritize what has to be done now versus what can wait. Your job, taking care of the kids, and paying bills are “now” tasks. Even though other things on your plate feel important, ask yourself if they are really priorities.</p>\n<p><strong>2. DIVIDE AND CONQUER</strong></p>\n<p>Sit down with your partner and make a chore list to decide who does what. Also, be sure to figure out when you need the most help from your partner and be sure to prioritize that time / task. If your partner has a lot on his/her plate, it can be helpful to know which items to drop and which to make sure get done.</p>\n<p><strong>3. THIS IS HARD</strong></p>\n<p>Let you partner know what you find most difficult about the situation. Maybe you feel neglected and that he/she don’t have time for you. Maybe you find grocery shopping really stressful! Try to work together to make this difficult time as positive as possible for you both.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Do you and your partner have difficulties because one or both of you finds it hard to express emotions or be open with feelings? Do you have different expectations for how often someone in a relationship should share his/her feelings? Does this lead to you not being as close as a couple or at least one of you feeling as if emotional intimacy is lacking in the relationship? If so, this activity will help you identify how to address these concerns.</p>\n<p>When one or both partners find it difficult to share feelings, it can rob the relationship of emotional closeness and eventually undermine trust in one another. When these issues arise, a difficult cycle can occur leading to relationship distress.</p>\n<h2>HELLO &#8211; ARE YOU THERE? I’VE GOT FEELINGS. WHERE ARE YOURS?</h2>\n<p>When partners differ in expectations around the appropriate frequency, quantity, and depth of emotions that should be shared in a romantic relationship, it can create a lot of hurt and frustration. The expressive partner may feel hurt or angry when his/her partner does not open up. The less expressive partner may feel frustrated when the expressive partner pushes for him/her to express more feelings.</p>\n<h3>The Expressive Partner</h3>\n<p>You may feel vulnerable that you always share how you feel while your partner does not. This can create feelings of loneliness or hurt that he/she doesn’t trust in you enough to be vulnerable. You may also get frustrated because, to you, emotions are an important part of relationships. When your partner is not expressive, you may pull away from your partner or repeatedly ask your partner to open up – and that may lead to your partner withdrawing from you even more.Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<h4>1. REMEMBER NATURAL DIFFERENCES</h4>\n<p>Remember your DEEP Understanding and consider how each of the DEEP components (especially differences in emotional expressiveness) could be contributing to what you and your partner are feelings. If your partner is low in emotional expressiveness, he/she isn’t going to think to do this naturally. So, you may need to decide on situations where this is okay (i.e., that you can accept) and situations where you want to insist your partner be more expressive. Come up with some ground rules you can both follow.</p>\n<h4>2. WHERE’S THE LOVE?</h4>\n<p>Look for other ways your partner shows his/her care. Does he/she hold your hand? Is he/she cuddly? Does he/she take care of things at home? Remember, he/she has feelings too. He/she may just show care in different ways. The trick is to give your partner the space to show affection in his/her own way and to the meaning behind them. If you try to force him/her to show you love in the exact way you want it, then your partner is going to feel overwhelmed and likely pull away.</p>\n<h4>3. OTHER KINDS OF INTIMACY</h4>\n<p>One way to increase emotional intimacy is to increase intimacy in other domains. Your partner may not be emotionally expressive, but there are other ways to connect with your partner that may pull for both of your strengths. If you both are comfortable with touch, consider cuddling, hugs, or sex as a way to feel more connected. Other suggestions include prioritizing date nights every once in a while or planning to do something fun together at least once a week such as doing a physical activity, cooking together, playing a game, or watching TV.</p>\n<h3>The Non-Expressive Partner</h3>\n<p>You may not understand what your partner is asking for when he/she asks you to open up or expresses feeling lonely and unloved when you don’t. Or you may feel uncomfortable sharing emotions even when you can recognize that you’re having some. When your partner pulls away from you or demands you open up, you may feel hurt, frustrated, or annoyed and respond by pulling away. You may also get frustrated because you can think of all the other ways you show your partner you love them and feel annoyed or hurt that your partner accuses you of being cold, unloving, and/or uncaring.Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<h4>1. REMEMBER NATURAL DIFFERENCES</h4>\n<p>When you start feeling frustrated about this, remember your DEEP Understanding and consider how each of the DEEP components (especially possible natural difference in emotional expressiveness) could be contributing to both you and your partner’s feelings. If the two of you are different, it will be important to talk about: a) situations/topics where it’s really important you try your best to open up and b) situations/topics that are really difficult for you to open up and maybe your partner needs to be more accepting of that.</p>\n<h4>2. TRY TO BE VULNERABLE WITH PARTNER</h4>\n<p>It may not be easy for you but one way your relationship will feel closer is if you can share things you usually keep to yourself, you might think of these as “vulnerable” emotions. By sharing your feelings such as when something hurt you or upset you, you will create a space of intimacy. Your partner will appreciate that you’ve opened up and you are likely to feel better that you got something off your chest. If sharing your feelings verbally is harder for you, consider writing your feelings down first and sharing those words with your partner. Or, you could write a letter or card for your partner.</p>\n<h4>3. OTHER KINDS OF CARE</h4>\n<p>Even if you are not comfortable expressing yourself, look for other opportunities to show your feelings such as through touch, cuddling, hand-holding, or remembering something your partner asked you to do around the house. Spending quality time together also indicates care, so you could consider planning a date night or an activity where you will have each other’s undivided attention. By showing your care through other means, your partner may be less likely to ask you to open up verbally to show your care.</p>\n<h2>VULNERABLE EMOTIONS? SHARING? NOT FOR US!</h2>\n<p>In some relationships, both partners find it hard to be open and share vulnerable feelings. As a result, both partners withdraw from each other and don’t share life’s events, whether positive or negative. When this happens, neither person gives their partner a chance to support him/her, robbing the relationship of opportunities to create emotionally-intimate moments. As a result, partners describe feeling like “roommates” and that they really only talk when plans need to be made such as childcare, paying the bills, schedules, etc. So what do you do when these cycle arise? Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<h4>1. REMEMBER NATURAL DIFFERENCES</h4>\n<p>Remember your DEEP Understanding and consider how each of the DEEP components (for example, a possible similarity in difficulty with emotional expressiveness or a pattern of both of you avoiding more difficult conversations) could be contributing to both you and your partner’s feelings. It may be that acceptance will help you worry less that the two of you are missing something in your relationship.</p>\n<h4>2. TRY TO BE VULNERABLE WITH EACH OTHER</h4>\n<p>It may not be easy for either of you but being more open can have positive effects. By sharing your feelings such as when something hurt you or upset you, you will create a space of intimacy. Since it may be hard at first to share feelings, try instead opening up about why the process of opening up is hard. You may even learn something about the other that you didn’t know and the process of being open in any capacity is likely to have positive effects on your relationship. Additionally, consider writing your feelings down first and sharing those words with each other. For example, you could both write letters or cards to each other.</p>\n<h4>3. SHARING SOME, BUT NOT ALL, OF THE TIME</h4>\n<p>Work together to identify topics or situations where it’s really important for both of you to fight your natural styles to not share. For example, situations where you’re feeling down/upset about something is often a really important time to reach out to your partner for support.</p>\n<h4>4. OTHER KINDS OF INTIMACY</h4>\n<p>One way to increase emotional intimacy is to increase intimacy in other domains. If you both are comfortable with touch, consider cuddling, hugs, or even sex as a way to feel more connected. Other suggestions include prioritizing date nights every once in a while or planning to do something fun together at least once a week such as doing a physical activity, cooking together, or playing a game.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Do you and your partner have different expectations for how you should handle living apart? For example, do you fight about how often you talk or how you can keep the connection despite the distance? Or has living apart interfered with one or both of you feeling emotionally close? If so, this blog post will help you identify how to address these concerns.</p>\n<p>Living apart from a partner is never easy. Because you may go a long time without seeing each other, the literal distance can often create emotional distance or a feeling that this relationship is not a priority to one or both partners. It can also create a problem when one partner’s expectations about long distance is different from the other’s. These issues often create the following cycle:</p>\n<p><em><strong>We Love Each Other, but This Doesn’t Always Feel Like a Relationship</strong></em></p>\n<p>You may both want to feel closer, but don’t know how to make it happen, or you may fight about one partner caring more to stay connected. Additionally, when you are together, it might be hard to prioritize couple time while also trying to spend time with friends and family. So what do you do?</p>\n<p>The more you fight about long distance, the more frustration or hurt you may feel. Moreover, long distance can make it harder to share the mundane day-to-day activities, challenges, and accomplishments of each of your lives, which can lead to feeling disconnected and lonely. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h2>TALK ABOUT YOUR DAY</h2>\n<p>Geographically close couples often talk about the little events in life that have either happened or are upcoming &#8211; which over time builds closeness and intimacy; however, when in a long distance relationship, it can be easy to forget to include your partner in these small life details. Therefore, start every call with taking five minutes to ask each other how your days were and to share in each other’s worlds, even when miles apart.</p>\n<h2>MAKE THE MINUTES COUNT</h2>\n<p>Long distance couples often think that talking all the time is the solution to their feelings of disconnectedness. But sometimes, this can create more problems. Think about it. When you live close to someone, you likely don’t call them every five minutes to say hi. Instead, you probably wait until something big happens or after work/school to talk. One recommendation then is for you to prioritize quality of conversation versus quantity. If you are always on the phone with nothing to say, you may start resenting each other. Instead, make the most of the calls you have and when you are on the phone with each other, share your day, talk about how much you miss each other, or talk about your shared values and interests. Additionally, consider being creative by sending each other pictures, audio clips, or videos. When you each put in this effort to stay connected, you’re both more likely to feel loved and attended to.</p>\n<h2>SET SOME GROUND RULES</h2>\n<p>Long distance couples often differ on how much time to spend on the phone, how much to say, whether to use the phone or Skype/Gchat/FaceTime, etc., and/or who is commuting for the next visit. This can often cause a lot of tension. If this is true for you, use the Respond conversation to discuss your expectations for how you can both feel fulfilled in the relationship. Remember, there might be parts of the DEEP Understanding which can help you better understand your partner’s point of view.</p>\n<h2>MIX UP YOUR TIME TOGETHER</h2>\n<p>When you’re together, try to do activities alone (just the two of you) as well as activities together with friends or family. When one person is long distance, it’s important that person get to know friends/family and be a part of the partner’s social life. That way, when the partner talks about things that have happened with friends/family, the long-distance person can know those people and be involved in the conversation. Involving the long-distance person in the partner’s social life also communicates to other that your relationship is important – potentially protecting it against unwanted advances by other potential partners.</p>\n<h2>DATE EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH YOU’RE MILES APART</h2>\n<p>Geographically close couples often prioritize date nights every once in a while. Don’t let the miles between you stop you from doing the same. There are plenty of activities that can be done such as watching a TV show at the same time or playing an online game that will allow you to take each other out on a date or feel connected.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Do you and your partner disagree over how much you communicate with one another? Does one person’s desire to share more – either frequently or deeply – cause discomfort and conflict in the relationship? This blog post will help you identify common problems around lack of communication and give you some ideas on how to solve it.</p>\n<h2>Issues Around Lack of Communication Can Have Different Forms</h2>\n<p>The frequency or depth of communication that each person is comfortable with will differ between partners, and many couples find it tricky to find a balance that is satisfying to both people. Often times, one person feels alone from the lack of communication while the other feels overwhelmed or smothered. Couples struggling with lack of communication tend to experience one of two common cycles: not talking often and avoiding deeper feelings.</p>\n<h3>1. NOT TALKING OFTEN</h3>\n<p>When one of you wants to share everything and the other is more private, both members feel frustrated with the amount or frequency of communication.</p>\n<h3>The One Who is Always Talking</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, you might get really frustrated with your partner for not starting conversation, not checking in with you throughout the day, or just being preoccupied about something else. You feel like you’re doing your part, but they just don’t respond. It feels like you’re living with a stranger! Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>A. SCHEDULE TALK TIME</h4>\n<p>Rather than starting up important conversations as soon as they come to your mind or as soon as you seen your partner, let him/her know that you would like to plan a time to talk. Let your partner know (briefly) what the topic is about so that you can both come to the conversation ready to talk about the topic at hand.</p>\n<h4>B. TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE</h4>\n<p>If you are a talker, an extrovert, or just love communicating (and your partner doesn’t), try to find other outlets for your love for connection. Chat with friends or family on the phone, or try to find a job or volunteer work that allows you to use your social side.</p>\n<h4>C. AGREE TO A SIGNAL</h4>\n<p>You and your partner can work together to agree on a signal that indicates he/she is tired of talking and needs a break. This signal doesn’t excuse him/her from the conversation – you should both agree on a time to come back to it. But taking a break can be helpful for both partners to clear their heads before coming back together to continue talking.</p>\n<h3>The Silent One</h3>\n<p>When you are the less talkative one in a couple, your partner’s constant desire to share can be overwhelming and turn you off to talking about anything. The more they push, the more you withdraw. You want to know about the important stuff about your partner – but it’s not all important stuff! Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>A. START SMALL</h4>\n<p>Figure out what little changes you can make to share more with your partner. Maybe send them a quick text about what you are doing when you are apart. Or, commit to sharing one story from your day with your partner each evening. Just sharing the best and worst thing from your day can help your partner feel more part of your life.</p>\n<h4>B. FIND COMMON GROUND</h4>\n<p>Is there a hobby or interest that you and your partner both enjoy that you can connect over? Whether it be your children or a new episode of a TV show, finding something you are both passionate about can be a great way to start talking more.</p>\n<h4>C. AGREE TO A SIGNAL</h4>\n<p>You and your partner can work together to agree on a signal that indicates when you are tired of talking and need a break. This signal doesn’t excuse you from the conversation – you should both agree on a time to come back to it – but taking a break can be helpful for both partners to clear their heads before coming back together to continue talking.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>2. AVOIDING DEEPER FEELINGS</h3>\n<p>Even if you and your partner talk pretty regularly, sharing the deeper feelings and more private parts of ourselves with our partner can sometimes be challenging. Sharing hidden emotions is difficult to do. When one or both partners struggle to open up and share these vulnerable feelings, it can make the relationship feel surface level or leave you feeling emotionally distanced from your partner. Tips to improve this problem:</p>\n<h4>A. VALIDATE WHAT YOUR PARTNER SHARES</h4>\n<p>When your partner opens up to share a hidden emotion with you or shares a deeper feeling, validate it! Thank them for being vulnerable with you, paraphrase what you heard them say (like when you are in the listener role). Try your best not to disagree with what they are feeling or compete with their emotions (e.g. “you were sad, well I was devastated!”). Every person is entitled to their own feelings, and when you partner shares one of those with you, let them know you understand them – even if you don’t agree.</p>\n<h4>B. FOCUS ON YOUR SHARING</h4>\n<p>Although it might be easier to wait for your partner to start one of these deep conversations or share a hidden emotion, remember you are working together as a team, and change starts with you! It’s okay, and even good, to let your partner know you are nervous about sharing.</p>\n<h4>C. SHARE SMART</h4>\n<p>If you try to start a deep conversation while your partner is cooking dinner, the baby is crying, and the TV is blaring, you probably know from experience that it isn’t going to go anywhere. Instead, pick a time to have these conversations when both you and your partner can focus on one another – just like you’ve been doing with the conversations in the program. Whether it is early morning or in the evening that works best, pick a time when both of you can focus on one another with few interruptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Do you and your partner have trouble making decisions, finding compromise, or problem solving issues? Communicating effectively so both partners feel heard and are satisfied with the result is no easy task! Finding a compromise between two different people can be hard to do—especially if it’s about a topic that touches on hidden emotions. If you’re in this situation, it is likely difficult for you and your partner to agree on a middle ground. Or if you can find a compromise, maybe you have trouble putting your plan into action. Couples struggling with decision making tend to experience one of two common cycles: Finding the middle ground, and all talk no walk.</p>\n<h2>Finding The Middle Ground</h2>\n<p>My partner wants one thing. I want the opposite. Where do we even begin? Many couples struggle to compromise when trying to solve difficult issues. You may argue about which one of you should compromise, or where compromise even starts. Sometimes, it can be hard to balance the needs and desires of each person, and each person is unwilling to give up what is important to him/her. When that happens, it may create fights in the relationship.</p>\n<h3>1. FAIR IN THE LONG RUN MAY NOT BE FAIR IN THE SHORT RUN</h3>\n<p>Sometimes it’s really hard to find a compromise that feels fair – either because there is no middle ground (it’s a Yes or No decision) or because you both feel really strongly about the issue. If that’s the case, consider letting one person “win” this time with the agreement that the other person will “win” the next time you have a situation where the two of you can’t find a compromise. For you basketball fans out there, this is the “possession arrow” idea – when there is a tie-up and both teams have equal claim to the ball, they take turns getting the ball. Ideally, the two of you don’t keep rigid score but instead have a general sense about who has sacrificed more recently for the good of the relationship.</p>\n<h3>2. FOCUS ON SELF CHANGE</h3>\n<p>Remember that you and your partner are working together as a team. So, be sure to consider ways you can improve or prevent the pattern by changing the way you act before and during a discussion of the core issue. After all, you and your partner are both at least partially responsible for the issues you two have, and some problems may have started with something either of you did (or didn’t do). At the end of the day, being in a relationship means sometimes putting the “we” ahead of the “I” in order to make a relationship work.</p>\n<h3>3. BRAINSTORM FREELY &amp; CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS</h3>\n<p>Know that when you’re brainstorming ways to compromise, no idea is stupid. Then, when you’ve developed a few ideas, put one of them to the test. Try an idea out for a short period of time, knowing you’ll re-evaluate it soon at a later date. Be sure to hold back any judgment of yourself or your partner during this process.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>All Talk Not Walk</h2>\n<p>It’s great when you and your partner agree to a compromise, but it can be frustrating when it feels like no actions or changes result from it.</p>\n<h3>The Partner Trying to Change</h3>\n<p>“Why am I the only one working on this? Didn’t we both agree to change?” Sometimes, you might get really frustrated with your partner for not following through on what you talked about. You feel that you are holding up your end of the bargain and he/she is letting you down again.Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>1. FRUSTRATION GETS IN THE WAY</h4>\n<p>When you realize that you’re not yet making the progress you expected, or when you think your partner isn’t trying, it can be really frustrating. When we’re really upset, angry, or stressed, we tend to get defensive or lash out at our partners – despite our best intentions. When this happens, don’t expect yourself or your partner to be able to make the changes you’ve been talking about. Instead, take a break, call a time out, and come back to it when you’re feeling better.</p>\n<h4>2. WHY IS THIS SO HARD FOR MY PARTNER?</h4>\n<p>If the change is harder or more complicated than your partner expects, try to remember that your partner gave the change a try but the plan the two of you worked out didn’t work. In other words, try not to get upset, angry, or frustrated with your partner. Instead, this can be a good time to modify the initial solutions you came up with. It’s not unusual to have to try a few different solutions before finding one that works. In fact, we’ve even built this into the OurRelationship program! In the optional Strengthen phase, you’ll have a chance to re-evaluate how the changes you decided on in the Respond phase are going and make changes to those plans.</p>\n<h4>3. MY PARTNER KEEPS FALLING INTO OUR OLD PATTERN</h4>\n<p>If you realize that the problem is happening but your partner doesn’t, use a non-blaming label to describe what’s going on. Sometimes a simple “I think we’re getting into it again” can be enough to allow you both to shift gears, consider your DEEP understanding, and apply any relevant changes your partner agreed to. And the more often you label the problem when it occurs, the easier it will become for your partner to recognize the problem when it comes up</p>\n<h4>4. WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM</h4>\n<p>Remember that you’re working together as a team to make things better. Sometimes you’re not going to do a great job. And sometimes your partner isn’t going to do a good job. But, if you notice your partner having trouble with the change, try to help them out. Helping each other rather than attacking each other is going to go a long way in improving your relationship.</p>\n<h3>The Other Partner</h3>\n<p>“I’m doing my best to follow through on our agreement! But it’s hard to change.”</p>\n<p>When you and your partner make a compromise to try things differently, it can be hard to remember to actually do it. Sometimes, what seemed like a good idea turns out to not work so well.Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>1. UNDERSTAND THE BARRIERS TO CHANGE</h4>\n<p>Even when we decide to take the risk to change and give it our best shot, there are always things that get in our way. When you start trying out the change, it may just feel “weird” or awkward for a while. This tends to be most common when you’re trying to do more positives (instead of fewer negatives). Let your partner know if you’re feeling stuck, and try to brainstorm ways to navigate around each barrier.</p>\n<h4>2. CHANGE IS HARDER THAN EXPECTED</h4>\n<p>Despite our best efforts, sometimes the solutions we come up with aren’t working like we hoped. We’re doing our best to change but either those changes aren’t really solving the problem or the changes are just too difficult to do for a long period of time. This can be a good time to re-evaluate the initial solutions you came up with, and develop new solutions that may get at the heart of the problem or be easier to enact. Talk to your partner and find a time to talk about this – ignoring the fact that you’re not following through on your initial agreements is only going to make it worse!</p>\n<h4>3. IT’S HARD TO RECOGNIZE WHEN THE PROBLEM IS HAPPENING</h4>\n<p>If identifying the problem in the moment is going to be a problem for you, talk to your partner about your concerns. Your partner may be able to help you by saying something like “I think we’re getting into it again.” Something that simple can be enough to let you take a step back and let your DEEP understanding and change plan kick in. And the more often you label the problem when it occurs, the easier it becomes for you to recognize the problem when it comes up.</p>\n<h4>4. WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM</h4>\n<p>Remember that you’re working together as a team to make things better. Sometimes you’re not going to do a great job. And sometimes your partner isn’t going to do a good job. But, if you notice you’re having trouble with the change, try to talk it out with your partner. If you need help getting the conversation going, try using the Speaker Listener or Problem Solving conversation structures in the program!</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>It’s common, if not inevitable, that you and your partner will have arguments now and again. But when you and your partner have trouble stopping an argument once it stops, it can have a real impact on your ability to communicate effectively.</p>\n<p>Tips to improve this problem:</p>\n<h2>1. Recognize When You Need a Time Out</h2>\n<p>If you or your partner are feeling cornered, attacked, or need a break from the conversation, it’s best to stop the conversation. Think about what signs there are that things are starting to get out of hand (such as, “I start feeling tense” or “he gets louder” or “she starts cursing”). When you notice these signs in the moment, tell your partner it’s time for a time out.</p>\n<h2>2. Take a Time Out</h2>\n<p>If you or your partner are ready for a time out, be careful not to just walk away – that’s just going to make things worse. Instead, tell the other partner that the two of you can talk about it later when you’ve both calmed down or thought more about it. Your partner may want to set a specific time to revisit the issue (such as “after the kids go to bed” or “after I get home”) and stick to that promise.</p>\n<h2>3. Let You and Your Partner Recover</h2>\n<p>There isn’t a right or wrong way to recover from a fight. Do try to clear your head and not continue having the argument in your thoughts. Take a walk, play a video game, or take a hot shower – whatever helps you relax. When one of you notices the other is still struggling with the argument, try to resist the urge to convince him/her that everything is fine or to make judgments about whether or not they’re over it yet. Letting your partner process in his/her own way without trying to speed it up may decrease the likelihood of another fight. Your partner may also really appreciate you letting him/her deal with it in their own way.</p>\n<h2>4. Timing Back In</h2>\n<p>Give yourselves time to recover from the argument before “timing in” again. That may take the edge off some of your emotions and allow you to talk about it more calmly. Decide how you and your partner will let each other know that you’re ready to revisit the discussion again and agree on it before another fight occurs. Once you’re ready to “time in” again, use the Speaker/Listener structure to either discuss how you’re feeling about the topic, or problem solve the issue. Recall that problem solving can be broken down into 4 steps:</p>\n<h3>1) Define the problem</h3>\n<h3>2) Brainstorm solutions to the problem</h3>\n<h3>3) Decide which changes you’d each like to make</h3>\n<h3>4) Set a time to re-evaluate how those changes are working in the near future</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Arguments are a part of every relationship but if you find yourselves having heated disagreements over the same issues over and over again, or if every conversation with your partner ends up in a fight, you may be trapped in a never-ending cycle of relationship arguments. Find out how to recognize the warning signs and address your specific argument patterns to turn relationship conflict into opportunity</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“One minute we’re talking about our weekend plans and the next minute we’re screaming at each other.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Have you noticed that even small topics quickly cascade into full-blown arguments with your partner? This is a very common pattern in relationship arguments and resolving it depends on two critical steps: recognizing the signs and addressing the underlying issues.</p>\n<h2>1. Know the warning signs</h2>\n<p>Every couple is different so recognizing the warning signs will depend on you and your partner’s unique communication style. Typically, things such as walking away from a talk, raising your voice or switching to accusatory style, and using heated language point to a discussion quickly snowballing into an argument. If you notice any of these signs (or other, more characteristic of you and your partner), check in with your partner. Sometimes, bad timing is to blame: find out if this is a bad time for them to have a conversation and together figure out when a good time may be. Avoid speaking down or the “mind-reading” trap: trying to read into what your partner is saying and interpreting it for the worse. Steer the conversation back to the original topic if you find yourself drifting back to old, unresolved issues.</p>\n<h2>2. Speaking/listening skills</h2>\n<p>One of the key issues that turn discussions into relationship arguments is talking over each other. Focus on your speaking and listening skills, instead. Try the Speaker/Listener exercise:<br />\nthe partner in the speaker role shares their point and does their best to open up. Once finished, the Listener recaps what they’ve heard, which gives the Speaker an opportunity to<br />\nclarify misunderstandings. After this, swap roles and try your best to avoid using any blaming or judging language in either role.</p>\n<h2>3. Break the cycle</h2>\n<p>Do you find you and your partner seem to have the same argument over and over again? Typically, this is a sign that you’re’ leaving arguments unresolved. These can “bleed” into later discussions and escalate even innocent topics into full-blown shouting matches. When you find yourself struggling with a problem, use the Speaker/Listener dynamics to resolve it fully.</p>\n<h2>4. Write it down</h2>\n<p>This approach to conflict resolution is particularly suitable if you would like to discuss a partner’s pain point or revisit an old argument. Writing your thoughts and feelings down can<br />\nhelp you structure them better. Go over the text before you hand it to your partner to ensure there are no instances of blaming or judging language to avoid being sucked into the same<br />\npattern.</p>\n<h2>5. Know when to avoid discussion</h2>\n<p>To avoid relationship arguments, know the appropriate times to have “a talk”. Steer clear of serious topics if you or your partner are distracted (e.g. driving), surrounded by friends, children or family, if either of you is tired, hungry or ill, and on special occasions (as emotions are already heated). Follow these tips the next time you feel yourself and your partner being sucked into the cycle of never-ending relationship arguments.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Do you and your partner have different expectations for how much time you spend together? Does one of you think you should spend more time together while the other wants more alone time?</p>\n<p>There is no right or wrong answer when it comes to how much time you should spend with your significant other because every couple is different. What works for one couple might not work for another.</p>\n<p>When spending time together, it&#8217;s important to find a perfect time balance that is going to benefit your specific relationship.</p>\n<p>While our <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">online couple&#8217;s therapy</a> is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804631/\">scientifically proven to benefit relationships</a>, these tips can first provide you with a solid foundation for time spent together in your relationship.</p>\n<h2>For the Partner Who Wants More &#8220;Us&#8221; Time</h2>\n<p>Do you resent the time your partner wants to spend by themselves because you think it shows that your relationship is <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/170922_114041_m30/index.html#/id/co-100\">not important to them</a>?</p>\n<p>This is a valid feeling, and you&#8217;re not the only person who feels like this. The more your partner wants alone time, the more you feel not cared.</p>\n<p>You may push for more time together, which may make your partner pull away. Or, you may withdraw from the relationship to protect yourself.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it can feel like no matter what you do, you can&#8217;t win. However, there are some ways that you can fix this problem in your relationship.</p>\n<h3>1. Reveal Your Hidden Emotions</h3>\n<p>You may feel hurt that your partner wants to spend time alone, and it is important to express how you feel. When you communicate this, try not to demand that your partner changes. Instead, try to be vulnerable and share with your partner exactly why it is important to you spending time together.</p>\n<p>Maybe hidden emotions are playing a role or maybe natural differences are intensifying the problem. Whatever it may be, it is important to discuss what you are feeling.</p>\n<h3>2. Seek Out Your Partner&#8217;s Hidden Emotions</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s a big difference between your partner not wanting to be with you and your partner wanting to do an activity that doesn&#8217;t involve both of you. It is easy to assume that time apart is evidence that your partner doesn&#8217;t care about you.</p>\n<p>However, that might not be the problem at all, and you won&#8217;t know until you communicate. So, talk about it with your partner!</p>\n<h3>3. Grow Your Social Group</h3>\n<p>No one can be everything to anyone. In other words, it&#8217;s healthy to have more than one person you can open up to, depend on, and have fun with. So, if your partner is the only person who fills those needs for you, we&#8217;d recommend you try to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/how-make-friends-adult-ncna860971\">expand your social group</a>.</p>\n<p>That way, if your partner needs to enjoy their alone time, you can also go enjoy your time apart with a new social group. This will create a balance between your social life and your relationship, which is necessary for romantic relationships.</p>\n<h3>4. Respect Your Partner&#8217;s Differences</h3>\n<p>People often differ on how much time they want to spend alone or with other people. If your partner needs time alone, the most likely explanation is that it helps your partner recharge their batteries.</p>\n<p>By giving your partner their alone time, they will be more refreshed and more likely to be present the next time you spend time together. For your partner, there may be a lot of truth in the saying &#8220;absence makes the heart grow fonder&#8221;.</p>\n<p>While you may not feel the same, it is important to recognize that no two people are exactly the same. It is also important to realize that alone time does not mean your partner doesn&#8217;t want to be around you, but that they just don&#8217;t want to be around anyone.</p>\n<h3>5. Make the Most of Time Spent Together</h3>\n<p>When you&#8217;re together, try not to worry about when it will end. Be present in the moment and recognize enjoying time spent with your partner. Your partner will appreciate how relaxing your time spent together is, which might increase the likelihood of it happening more often!</p>\n<h2>For the Partner Who Wants More &#8220;Me&#8221; Time</h2>\n<p>Do you feel that you need to take time for yourself or else you may begin to resent your partner? Do you feel that the more your partner pushes you to spend time together, the more resentful you feel?</p>\n<p>These are emotions are not unheard of in relationships. A common reaction to these emotions may be to just simply withdraw yourself from the situation to avoid conflict.</p>\n<p>However, that might not be the best way to handle this problem in your relationship. Instead, try implementing some of these tips to help you handle how much time you spend with your partner.</p>\n<h3>1. A Deep Understanding</h3>\n<p>Remember your deep understanding, natural differences, emotions, external stress, and communication patterns play a role in your relationship. For example, if your partner is wanting more time together, their hidden emotions may pop up when you don&#8217;t make that time.</p>\n<p>Try to put yourself in your partner&#8217;s shoes and recognize where their hurt feelings are coming from. Validate your partner by communicating that you appreciate how much the relationship means to them.</p>\n<h3>2. Compromise</h3>\n<p>You may need time for yourself to recharge your batteries, but you should also prioritize time together with your partner. Identify instances during the week when you and your partner can spend uninterrupted time together.</p>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t always about what you do when you spend time with your partner. The important part is that you are making an effort to spend time with your partner. You could even consider involving your partner in some of the activities you currently do by yourself or with your friends. Just taking that initiative to include them in your life can make all of the difference.</p>\n<h3>3. Be Specific About Your Needs</h3>\n<p>It is completely understandable if you want to take time to yourself. However, when you do take time for yourself, make sure to communicate why you need time so your partner understands it is not because of relationship problems.</p>\n<p>You may say something such as, &#8220;I am feeling stressed or overwhelmed and a few hours by myself will make me feel better so that I can be better when we spend time together next.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Again, taking that initiative to show that you are putting in effort can make all of the difference.</p>\n<h3>4. Be Specific About Spending Time Together</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s important not only to spend more time with your partner, but also to be on the same page about <a href=\"https://bucketlistjourney.net/couples-bucket-list-things-to-do/\">spending time together</a>. If one of you thinks an activity counts as time spent together while the other one does not, then the lack of communication could be damaging to your time together.</p>\n<p>You and your partner don&#8217;t have to have the same exact interests as each other. In fact, differences in opinion and free time choices are often encouraged in order to diversify your relationship. Instead of trying to find something that both of you want to do, take turns letting each other choose the date, movie, or restaurant.</p>\n<p>Without the added fighting, you&#8217;ll each be able to better enjoy your time together.</p>\n<h2>Balancing Spending Time Together</h2>\n<p>Remember that it&#8217;s important to consider your partner&#8217;s view and why they feel strongly about the issue. Also, start by making your own changes first as this will increase the likelihood that your partner will also make changes.</p>\n<p>When spending time together, make sure it is quality time. The more you increase the quality of the time spent together, the more your relationship will grow, even if the amount of time spent together is not as frequent as one of you may like. Let your partner know how much you appreciate the time spent together.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

Unsure of what you can do to get your relationship back on track? Well, don&#8217;t fret &#8212; we&#8217;re here to help with tips, tricks, and insights on how to give and get emotional support in your relationship.</p>\n<h2>What is Emotional Support?</h2>\n<p>Emotional support comes in a variety of sizes and shapes. At its core, however, emotional support is about providing love, support, reassurance, acceptance, and encouragement <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">in a relationship</a>. It&#8217;s especially important in times of stress or sadness as it stabilizes the relationship and provides a positive foundation for both partners.</p>\n<h2>What are the Signs a Relationship Lacks Emotional Support?</h2>\n<p>In order to address and improve emotional support within a relationship, you need to be able to identify when a relationship is lacking it. Here are some signs a relationship is lacking emotional support:</p>\n<h3>You and Your Partner Feel Distant</h3>\n<p>Without true emotional intimacy and support, you and your partner are bound to drift. Perhaps you and your partner are talking less or aren&#8217;t spending as much time together as you used to. If you&#8217;re not fueling your feelings of togetherness and connection, your relationship&#8217;s emotional support will ultimately break down.</p>\n<h3>You Don&#8217;t Discuss Your Emotions</h3>\n<p>Another sign your relationship is lacking emotional support is if you and your partner aren&#8217;t being fully honest or forthcoming with each other. When you don&#8217;t talk about feelings or emotions, you&#8217;re more likely to bottle up toxic ones or push your partner away out of fear. So do your best to open up about your daily problems and anxieties, and keep the lines of communication as open as possible.</p>\n<h3>You&#8217;re Leading Separate Lives</h3>\n<p>With this scenario, you and your partner aren&#8217;t only emotionally distant; you&#8217;re also spending very little time with each other. Maybe you don&#8217;t text much or go out on as many dates, or perhaps you&#8217;ve drawn up two distinctly different social groups.</p>\n<p>You should want your partner involved in your life and desire to spend a lot of time with them. If you don&#8217;t want to do this or feel uncomfortable doing so, you most likely have an emotionally distant relationship.</p>\n<h3>You&#8217;re Struggling with Listening Problems</h3>\n<p>Even if you and your partner are having frequent conversations, your emotional intimacy is lacking if you aren&#8217;t actively listening to each other. This can cause a myriad of problems like forgetting important birthdays, anniversaries, or failing to truly understand what the other person is trying to say in moments of vulnerability. You can address this problem by practicing active listening, and intentionally communicating and connecting with your partner with compassion and presence.</p>\n<h3>You&#8217;re Not Physically Intimate</h3>\n<p>Another big sign your relationship is lacking emotional support is if you and your partner aren&#8217;t engaging in physical intimacy. Partners who are unable to emotionally support each other find it more difficult to provide physical support to one another. If they&#8217;re avoiding your physical touch, talk to them and try to get at the root of where your physical intimacy issues stem.</p>\n<h2>How to Give (and Get) Emotional Support</h2>\n<p>Now that you know the signs of emotional support issues, you&#8217;re probably wondering how you and your partner can better support each other. Here are some expert tips to help you address your emotional intimacy and support issues:</p>\n<h3>Ask Questions</h3>\n<p>One of the most important parts of supporting your partner is showing up for them and actively listening to what they have to say. Show you have interest in what they have to say and express love and support as they answer any questions you have. Use <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/faq/\">open-ended questions</a> to evoke true discussion and let them say whatever it is they need to say.</p>\n<p>While listening, make sure to give your partner your undivided attention. Put away your phone and anything else that could pose as a distraction. Maintain eye contact, keep open body language, and use nonverbal cues to show them you&#8217;re receptive to what they&#8217;re saying.</p>\n<h3>Validate Their Feelings</h3>\n<p>Your focus in giving emotional support should be providing your partner with safe space where they can feel heard. This means avoiding giving advice unless you are specifically asked and refraining from telling the other person what they&#8217;re actually feeling or thinking. <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/relationship-advice_b_2127394\">Reassure your partner</a> their feelings are normal and you aren&#8217;t here to judge or criticize what they&#8217;re saying.</p>\n<h3>Show Your Support</h3>\n<p>If someone is expressing they need more emotional support, chances are they need help finding a way to feel emotionally centered again. Ask &#8220;what-if&#8221; questions and present options to them in a question format. Just remember you&#8217;re not there to fix their problems, but rather there to provide them support in finding a solution to their issue.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to show your support in tangible ways. Think of any concrete ways you can help or support them based on what they said. Do whatever you can to help them accomplish their action steps.</p>\n<h3>Provide Physical Touch</h3>\n<p>When it comes to romantic relationships, physical touch is incredibly important in communicating support. This touch doesn&#8217;t have to be explicitly sexual. Simple types of physical contact like walking arm in arm and cuddling can do wonders for emotional support issues.</p>\n<h3>Be Supportive of Your Partner in Public</h3>\n<p>Emotional support isn&#8217;t something you only have to do in private. Complimenting your partner in front of other people and speaking positively about them in front of their peers can make them feel great about themselves and you.</p>\n<h3>Give Small Gifts</h3>\n<p>Keep your romance alive by giving your partner gifts when they least expect. These gifts don&#8217;t have to be expensive, just trinkets or things that remind them how much you care about them. This makes both people in the relationship feel great.</p>\n<h3>Say &#8220;I Love You&#8221;</h3>\n<p>Sometimes the greatest way to show support to your partner is by saying &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/132111-heres-how-often-you-should-say-i-love-you-to-your-partner\">I love you</a>.&#8221; These three words provide the ultimate reassurance to any partner and can help them navigate any hardships they&#8217;re having inside or outside of the relationship.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts on Giving and Getting Emotional Support</h2>\n<p>Relationships aren&#8217;t easy; they need work and compromise, and can often be downright stressful and disheartening. But you shouldn&#8217;t let emotional support issues sabotage the relationship you have. By reviewing the tips and techniques in this article, you can show your partner you&#8217;re there for them, rebuild your relationship, and get things back on track.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

Many of these everyday issues can be overcome with some conversation and compromise.</p>\n<p>How do you know when your problems could use outside help like couples counseling?</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no perfect answer, but talking to a therapist is almost always a good idea. You might feel embarrassed at first, but a therapist isn&#8217;t there to judge. They just help you work through your troubles and give you tools to communicate better.</p>\n<p>Having trouble working through problems with your significant other? Read on for 10 common signs that you and your partner might benefit from couples counseling.</p>\n<h2>1. You&#8217;re Always Having the Same Fights</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re having the same fights over and over again, that&#8217;s a good sign that a therapist might be needed to help resolve it. It&#8217;s not helpful to just argue in circles.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s true even if the recurring fight is something small.</p>\n<p>You and your partner might constantly argue about doing the dishes. On their own, dirty dishes probably won&#8217;t put an end to your marriage. However, if it&#8217;s causing tension on a daily basis, that little fight might be a <a href=\"https://hellogiggles.com/love-sex/relationships/9-signs-little-fights-with-signficant-other-are-serious/\">sign of a larger issue</a>.</p>\n<p>When your partner always neglects the dishes it might make you feel like you have no support. You might also feel that lack of support in other areas in your relationship.</p>\n<p>The dishes just become an easy thing to fight about, when really there&#8217;s something bigger at play.</p>\n<h2>2. You Never Fight</h2>\n<p>Daily blow-out fights are an obvious sign that a relationship is in peril. However, never fighting is also a big sign, it&#8217;s just a little harder to notice.</p>\n<p>Fighting is natural in a long term relationship. If you&#8217;re not arguing once and a while, it might just mean you&#8217;re ignoring your issues altogether.</p>\n<p>Never fighting probably means that there&#8217;s a breakdown in communication. When you&#8217;re not airing out your issues to each other it causes other problems.</p>\n<p>You might begin to quietly resent your partner for something they don&#8217;t even know they&#8217;re doing. That resentment will build until it eventually explodes.</p>\n<p>Going to a therapist together will help you to bring up issues in a safe, neutral environment. Your therapist will also teach you how to better communicate together at home.</p>\n<h2>3. Recent or Upcoming Life Changes</h2>\n<p>Big changes or traumas can rock a relationship. That could be a death, a move, a new job or anything else that disrupts you or your partner&#8217;s life.</p>\n<p>You can visit a therapist after you&#8217;ve realized that this change is hurting your relationship. An even better idea is to talk to someone preemptively.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always easier to talk about your concerns before they happen or become unmanageable. That way you can both be aware and sensitive when and if they do come up.</p>\n<h2>4. You&#8217;re Having Issues with Physical Intimacy</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s to be expected that the raw passion you felt for your partner in the beginning will wane over time. But, if one or both of you are unhappy with your sex life, it might be time to see a therapist.</p>\n<p>Physical intimacy issues can mean different things to different couples.</p>\n<p>It could mean you&#8217;re on different pages about how often it should happen. Maybe one partner experienced a trauma that affects how they express physical intimacy. Perhaps you&#8217;re just not having any sex at all!</p>\n<p>Either way, talking about your needs and desires with your partner can be difficult. You might feel embarrassed or afraid to hurt the other&#8217;s feelings. Having someone else there to guide you can make all the difference.</p>\n<h2>5. You Have Differing Views About Money</h2>\n<p>Aside from physical intimacy, finances is another <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-fights-couples-have-2017-12\">common issue between couples</a>. The way you spend and make your money affects both partners. If you have differing views on the subject, it can drive a huge wedge between you.</p>\n<p>A person&#8217;s habits surrounding money is something that&#8217;s often deeply ingrained since childhood. If you have opposing views on the matter, it can be difficult to resolve it on your own. Because finances will always be a part of your lives together, this problem will keep coming up until it&#8217;s fixed.</p>\n<h2>6. You See Your Partner as the Problem</h2>\n<p>A relationship is more successful when both partners see themselves as part of a team. When it starts to feel like one person is the problem and becomes &#8220;the enemy&#8221; it might be time to talk to a therapist.</p>\n<p>In this situation, your partner might not be pulling their weight within the team. However, they likely aren&#8217;t the whole problem. It&#8217;s important that both people see how their actions affect the relationship.</p>\n<p>Learning what you are accountable for can be scary, but it&#8217;s healthy!</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">couples therapist</a> is not just a third party who will tell your partner why they&#8217;re wrong. They are there to work with both of you, so you can get on the same side again.</p>\n<h2>7. You&#8217;re Committed to Your Marriage</h2>\n<p>Do the other 9 signs not apply to you and your partner? Being committed to your relationship is as good a sign as any that you can benefit from couples counseling.</p>\n<p>Your relationship doesn&#8217;t need to be in peril for you to talk to someone. Like a car, it&#8217;s helpful to do periodic maintenance so it runs better. Catching a problem early can mean avoiding a breakdown in the future.</p>\n<p>When times are good, a therapist can help you both improve your communication skills. That way, when you hit a rough patch, you&#8217;re prepared to deal with it in a more productive manner.</p>\n<h2>Do You Think You Might Need Couples Counseling?</h2>\n<p>These are 7 signs that you might benefit from couples counseling. But, if you&#8217;re thinking about whether you need it, you probably do! There&#8217;s no shame in it- everyone can benefit from an outside perspective.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

Maybe one is working at home raising the kids, while the other is launching a startup. You are both so busy and exhausted that you may not have been physically intimate for weeks, even months.</p>\n<p>When couples can&#8217;t find time for romance, their relationships suffer. You may find you are fighting more frequently, talking less, and feeling resentful.</p>\n<p>How can you make time to be physically intimate when life gets really busy? Here are ten tips on how to salvage your sex life, and why it&#8217;s important.</p>\n<h3>1. Make a Date</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/scheduling-sex-could-save-your-relationship-but-theres-a-right-and-wrong-way-to-do-it\">Scheduling sex</a> may sound like a real buzzkill, but sometimes it is necessary to be as organized about this part of your life as you are about everything else.</p>\n<p>Just because you schedule some intimacy time, it does not mean it has to be boring or pedestrian. In fact, scheduling it gives you time to find that pretty lingerie in the back of your drawer, or jump in the shower after work.</p>\n<p>Show your partner that you are still as excited to be physically intimate with them as you were at the very beginning of the relationship.</p>\n<h3>2. Get a Babysitter</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard for new parents to leave a newborn to go out on the town. It&#8217;s hard to leave clinging toddlers, or school-age children clamoring for attention and help with homework.</p>\n<p>By the time you finish tending to the little ones, you probably aren&#8217;t feeling too keen on any physical intimacy.</p>\n<p>Get some help. Ask your mother or the neighborhood teenager to babysit for a few hours. You need to remember you are grownups and there is more to love than changing diapers.</p>\n<p>Book a motel room for a few hours, go park at a romantic lover&#8217;s lane! It&#8217;s worth the babysitting fees when you rekindle your passion for each other.</p>\n<h3>3. Go Away</h3>\n<p>Collapsing into the same bed every night, with texts pinging your phones and dogs and kids demanding attention&#8211;it&#8217;s not a recipe for exciting physical intimacy.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you need to get away from it all. Even if you are very busy, you need to make time for your loved one away from the distractions of day to day life.</p>\n<p>Maybe you can slip away to a mountain cabin out of cell phone range. Maybe you can afford to fly someplace warm, where you can swim in the ocean and remember how hot your partner looks in a bathing suit.</p>\n<h3>4. Talk About It</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-feel-more-comfortable-talking-about-sex-according-to-experts-12638086\">Talking about sex</a>&#8211;or the lack thereof&#8211;can be uncomfortable. The more uncomfortable you feel with your partner, the less likely you are to have sex with them. It becomes a vicious circle.</p>\n<p>Maybe your partner thinks you don&#8217;t feel attracted to her anymore. Maybe you think your partner is angry at you, when in fact he is just worried about something at work.</p>\n<p>If you do not open up about the issues affecting your romantic life, they can fester and get worse.</p>\n<h3>5. Get Couples Therapy</h3>\n<p>Many couples having challenges seek help from a therapist or counselor. Sometimes the presence of a third party professional enables honest communication in a way that you both may have forgotten.</p>\n<p>Not all therapy is expensive. There are effective <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">online programs for couples</a> seeking help in their relationships.</p>\n<h3>6. Try Massage</h3>\n<p>Reviving physical intimacy does not always have to involve actual sex. Sometimes couples need to become comfortable touching each other first.</p>\n<p>If you are overwhelmed and tense after a long day, ask your partner to massage your shoulders or your neck. Even a long, slow foot massage can prove relaxing and sensual.</p>\n<p>Focusing on each other and each other&#8217;s bodies can help bring you two together when outside life intervenes.</p>\n<h3>7. Watch a Sexy Movie</h3>\n<p>Anything is fine between consenting adults. In order to breathe new life in a relationship where the romance has taken a back seat, you may want to get a little adventurous.</p>\n<p>Watch something sexy on TV. Dress up. Visit an adult store and buy some novelties like toys or lotions.</p>\n<p>You may end up laughing, or loving it! No matter what, it can break down inhibitions and make life in the bedroom interesting again.</p>\n<h3>8. Look at Your Own Issues</h3>\n<p>Sometimes <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/individuals/\">one individual</a> in the relationship may need extra support. Before addressing the relationship issues, you may need to look into past traumas or issues which are currently affecting your present.</p>\n<p>Being in a long-term relationship can bring to light underlying issues out that we never knew where there. By working on your own challenges, you can clear away the troubles of the past and move forward in a healthy way.</p>\n<h3>9. Act Out a Fantasy</h3>\n<p>When real life gets busy, fantasy is a terrific outlet. Why not try a little role-playing with your partner?</p>\n<p>If you are sick and tired of giving orders every day at the office, why not play submissive with your mate, and let them give the commands? Or pretend to be two strangers who are having a spontaneous tryst. Anything that gets you out of the same old routine is sure to add some spice to your love life.</p>\n<h3>10. Learn to Say No&#8230;and Yes</h3>\n<p>If you are extremely busy with work, family and other obligations and it is hurting your relationship, you need to occasionally say no. Turn off the email. Turn down the invitation to the conference or that dinner party.</p>\n<p>Making your relationship a priority is essential to reviving physical intimacy and keeping love alive. You need to say &#8220;No&#8221; to the people demanding your time, and &#8220;Yes&#8221; to the most important person who truly deserves it.</p>\n<h3>Making Time to Be Physically Intimate: You&#8217;re Never Too Busy for Love</h3>\n<p>When you take time to be physically intimate in your relationship, you can improve trust and communication with your partner. By seeking help from professionals, you can find your way back from any distance that has grown since life became so busy.</p>\n<p>When you acknowledge that life has gotten in the way and you make affirmative steps to reconnect, you can both find fulfillment that extends beyond the physical.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

We get to flirt and go on adventures and get to know one another over the course of weeks or months or years.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that many of us already feel extremely close to our partner as we approach marriage, oftentimes we avoid some subjects because they&#8217;re uncomfortable, or because talking about them directly doesn&#8217;t come about naturally.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re on the verge of getting married, or you&#8217;ve only just begun to talk about the concept with your partner, there are some questions you&#8217;ve simply got to discuss with your partner when deciding whether or not marriage is the right choice for you.</p>\n<p>To see on a deeper level whether or not marriage is a good fit for you and your current partner, check out these 10 critical questions to ask before you get married.</p>\n<h2>1. Where Do We See Our Lives Going?</h2>\n<p>5 years, 10 years, 40 years down the line, where do you and your partner hope your lives will be?</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s right&#8211;we&#8217;re starting with a big one. If this answer to this question causes lots of disagreement or shows evidence of seriously-differing expectations from life, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/about/\">it&#8217;s important to take the time</a> to work through the answer to this question.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s natural for there to be some minor differences in expectation&#8211;but it&#8217;s important to discuss the areas in which one partner is unwilling to compromise, or where outlooks are at odds with the other&#8217;s.</p>\n<h2>2. What Are Our Thoughts on Children?</h2>\n<p>For many, this question may come up casually on a second or third date. For others, the question of intended family life can prove vastly more complicated and stressful.</p>\n<p>Be honest with your partner&#8211;do you hope to carry children? Do you want to adopt? Do you have little or no interest in building a family of your own?</p>\n<p>Rarely do <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/individuals/\">individuals&#8217; desire</a> for a family or lack thereof change after entering marriage. Understand what to expect from your partner from the beginning, and do your best to be on the same page.</p>\n<h2>3. How Do We Handle Stress?</h2>\n<p>The answer to this question may come about naturally over the course of the relationship. You&#8217;ll witness your partner when they&#8217;re stuck in traffic. You&#8217;ll see how they handle stress from work.</p>\n<p>But taking the time to understand how stress affects your relationship and might have an impact later on is extremely important.</p>\n<p>Remember that, in the decades you&#8217;ll spend together, plenty of pressure and stress will come along. Don&#8217;t let you or your partner be blindsided by the ways in which the other handles stress.</p>\n<h2>4. How Do We Handle Conflict?</h2>\n<p>In a similar vein, you may start to notice the ways in which your partner handles conflict as your relationship grows. This could be any sort of conflict-relevant to your relationship or not.</p>\n<p>Are your arguments healthy? Are your tense conversations safe and productive? Has anyone ever been physically injured in an argument? Has anyone felt a lasting emotional impact from a conflict?</p>\n<h2>5. What Are Our Relationships with Gambling, Drugs, and Alcohol?</h2>\n<p>While many people throughout the world have a healthy, social relationship to things like gambling, drugs, and alcohol, an attachment to any of these things that are over-the-top or begins affecting either partner more deeply can prove detrimental to a relationship.</p>\n<p>Signs of addiction are often easy to ignore or shrug off&#8211;but before you commit your life to another person, it&#8217;s imperative to address these problems, no matter how uncomfortable the conversation may seem.</p>\n<h2>6. How Will We Manage Finances?</h2>\n<p>Money issues are <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/04/money-is-the-leading-cause-of-stress-in-relationships.html\">one of the leading causes of strain</a> on modern marriage. While many couples, even those in serious relationships, maintain separate finances, marriage could likely change this fact, and it&#8217;s important to understand how.</p>\n<p>Money is connected to our sense of security and overall well being. It&#8217;s important to be open, clear, and honest when it comes to finances in order to pave a comfortable and sensible road for finances in your marriage.</p>\n<h2>7. What Would Happen If We Experienced a Change in Work Life?</h2>\n<p>Layoffs, promotions, and burnouts happen to each of us at some point in our work life. It&#8217;s necessary to understand the ways in which one another is connected to their job before entering into marriage.</p>\n<p>Nothing with work life is ever certain, but understanding things like whether either partner would be willing to relocate for the other&#8217;s career aspirations, or whether one partner&#8217;s salary is the one on which you depend most heavily can be crucial to your marriage. Be open and honest with one another about work life at all times.</p>\n<h2>8. Do We Expect Change from the Other After Marriage?</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s never a good idea to enter into marriage aware of a problem, but expecting a change in the other person that&#8217;ll solve it. If there&#8217;s something you&#8217;ve wished your partner would work on, tell them. If there&#8217;s a problem present in your marriage, work on it.</p>\n<p>In a perfect world, marriage and other life changes would be just what we needed to fix those longstanding problems. In reality, they&#8217;re usually not. If you&#8217;re expecting a change from your partner, communicate it. Don&#8217;t expect it to be brought on by marriage.</p>\n<h2>9. Are We Both Satisfied with Our Sex Life?</h2>\n<p>Although sex should always be had in order to express physical affection and to boost an otherwise-good relationship, people oftentimes find themselves in situations where sex is masking other problems&#8211;or where the <a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/dating/sex/less-sex-in-relationship-meaning/2015215\">sex itself becomes a problem</a>.</p>\n<p>Be clear about your feelings toward your sex life. Is one partner more adventurous than the other? Does one have a consistently higher sex drive? Do we enjoy our time being intimate with one another?</p>\n<h2>10. How Important Is Upkeep of Physical Appearance?</h2>\n<p>Going forward from marriage, some things will change. For some couples, a major change in physical appearance comes when one partner begins to be more relaxed at times, without always striving to look their best.</p>\n<p>An important aspect of marriage is understanding that your relationship is built on love, not on the physical and superficial elements of a relationship. Ensure that you and your partner feel the same with regards to one another&#8217;s physical appearance&#8211;and remember that love should always come first.</p>\n<h2>Want More Questions to Ask Before You Get Married?</h2>\n<p>Marriage vows are one of the deepest, most all-encompassing commitments you can make to another person. In order to ensure you&#8217;ll have a long, healthy, and happy relationship with your partner throughout your marriage, you&#8217;ll need to be open and honest with each other&#8211;even if it means asking the tough questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Are you experiencing problems in your relationship but don&#8217;t want to break up?</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry, your relationship isn&#8217;t doomed. Rather, you&#8217;re going through a rough patch in your relationship. And this is perfectly normal.</p>\n<p>When the honeymoon phase is over, getting to <strong>REALLY</strong> know each other is difficult for all couples. And no one is perfect.</p>\n<p>This is why it&#8217;s best to try and work things out before calling the whole relationship quits. Fortunately, there&#8217;s a way you can work through any problem.</p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s still hope in your relationship, here are 9 tips to get through a rough patch in a relationship.</p>\n<h2>1. Try and Spend More Time Together</h2>\n<p>Oftentimes, relationships struggle because you and your partner don&#8217;t spend enough time together. And it&#8217;s understandable why.</p>\n<p>Many couples have conflicting work schedules or life happens. Long distance relationships are also on the rise, which is always a struggle.</p>\n<p>Try to make time for each other as much as possible. Plan a date or just plan a Netflix night once a week.</p>\n<h2>2. Identify Bad Behavior</h2>\n<p>A relationship can either bring out the best or the worst in us. Do you notice you&#8217;re always in a crabby mood when you&#8217;re with your partner? Or do you notice your partner is progressively becoming more depressed or negative?</p>\n<p>Your partner should bring out the best in you. But if the opposite is happening, reflect back on your or your partner&#8217;s behavior and try to identify the culprit. Who knows &#8211; it may not have anything to do with the relationship.</p>\n<h2>3. Hold Onto Trust</h2>\n<p>Trust is the foundation for every relationship. Even during the bad times, you should always hold on to trust.</p>\n<p>Trust can be anything. Trust can mean you know all of your problems will work out. Trust can also mean your partner will never go behind your back, even during the tough times.</p>\n<p>Even if you two are fighting or if the spark is fading, trust will always bring you two back together.</p>\n<h2>4. Remember the Good Times</h2>\n<p>During the bad times, it&#8217;s always easy to be negative and feel resentment toward your partner. But you get what you put out into the universe.</p>\n<p>If you want the relationship to work out, start feeling more positive. The easiest way to do this is by remembering the good times.</p>\n<p>The good times can mean anything.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was a special day, like your first date or a wedding day. It can also be a combination of the times your partner made you smile and laugh. Even focusing on what you love about your partner can also bring positivity.</p>\n<h2>5. Never Stop Loving Them</h2>\n<p>Love is unconditional. That means your love is strong during the good times&#8230;and the bad. Even during this difficult time, never stop loving them.</p>\n<p>But this is easier said than done. You could be mad at your partner or feeling negatively toward them. In order for the relationship to work, the flame can&#8217;t go out. And this isn&#8217;t easy when you&#8217;re going through a rough patch.</p>\n<p>Little things <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/stronger-the-broken-places/201505/13-ways-keep-love-alive\">keep love alive</a>, such as &#8220;good morning&#8221; and &#8220;goodnight&#8221; text messages. Remember back to a time when your love was the deepest. Repeat this time by going out on little dates or doing things you did back then.</p>\n<h2>6. Listen</h2>\n<p>Talking is easy in a relationship. You have a lot of things on your mind and you can&#8217;t way to spill it all out on your partner. But this may not be as beneficial as you think.</p>\n<p>Instead of opening your mouth, open your ears. Let your partner talk first. You&#8217;ll be surprised how effective this can be; who knows, maybe your partner already knows the solutions to your problems.</p>\n<h2>7. Keep the Attraction Alive</h2>\n<p>During the bad times, the last thing you may think about is sex. But you&#8217;ll be shocked at how many problems sex can solve.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.boldsky.com/relationship/love-and-romance/2014/twenty-reasons-why-physical-intimacy-is-important-046481.html\">Intimacy is important</a> in any relationship. Sex and attraction are what truly helps you two connect. Sex also boosts feel-good neurotransmitters that can put you two in a happier mood.</p>\n<p>Are you still uncomfortable with sex during this time? You can still do little things to fire that spark. Wear sexy outfits around the house. Kiss and hold each other more. Any physical intimacy will re-ignite that spark.</p>\n<h2>8. Ask Advice From Family and Friends</h2>\n<p>No one knows you and your relationship better than your family and friends. That&#8217;s why they will have a thing or two to say about the situation. Who knows, they have probably been through a similar situation.</p>\n<p>Ask their advice. They may have something valuable to say. They can also help describe why you feel a certain way. And some people would rather be a sounding board so you can share your hurt and anger.</p>\n<h2>9. You Both Have to Make It Work</h2>\n<p>Even if the love is still there, the relationship won&#8217;t work unless both of you are willing to make it work. If <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/individuals/\">one person</a> is putting their all into the relationship, it will inevitably fail.</p>\n<p>What does this mean? You both have to agree that you&#8217;ll do what you can to improve the relationship. You both also have to agree that the both of you want this relationship to work.</p>\n<p>This also means if your partner is too discouraged or lazy to work on the relationship, you need to pull the plug.</p>\n<h2>You Can Repair a Rough Patch in a Relationship</h2>\n<p>Suffering through a rough patch in a relationship is difficult for any couple. But just remember that no relationship is perfect. As long as there&#8217;s love and a will to make it work, you and your partner can overcome any relationship issues.</p>\n<p>Use these tips and give it some time. Just try and be positive. You and your partner will work things out.</p>\n<p>Another great way to repair your relationship is through couples counseling.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

Sometimes, problems arise in our marriages that we can&#8217;t just &#8220;get over&#8221; because we love each other.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, we need a helping hand.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/7-signs-you-and-your-partner-could-benefit-from-couples-counseling/\">Couples counseling</a> can give you and your spouse a safe place to work through your conflict with a third party.</p>\n<p>But convincing your spouse to see a counselor with you can be a minefield. If you&#8217;re not careful, the therapy talk could cause another huge argument.</p>\n<h2>Be Honest About Your Struggles</h2>\n<p>Open and honest communication is an important part of any healthy marriage.</p>\n<p>But so is choosing your battles. Sometimes, we try to convince ourselves that certain things aren&#8217;t big deals. We don&#8217;t want to start a fight or look like we&#8217;re irrational, so we let it slide.</p>\n<p>But sometimes, those things tend to build up and cause huge blocks in communication. We go months without telling them what&#8217;s wrong because we feel like it&#8217;s been too long for it to matter.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re worried that if we suggest therapy, our spouse will feel like we aren&#8217;t happy with them anymore.</p>\n<p>More often than not though, your spouse knows that your marriage is not ideal. Being honest about your struggles can help open the door to healing.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t Play the Blame Game</h2>\n<p>&#8220;It takes two to tango,&#8221; as the saying goes. In most struggling marriages, there are no innocent parties.</p>\n<p>Nobody&#8217;s perfect. And for the most part, if your marriage is on the rocks, both of you contributed to that situation.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t come into the therapy talk with finger-pointing and blaming. Tell your spouse that you don&#8217;t care whose fault it is. You just want to get better.</p>\n<p>Chances are, they want to help your marriage too. Keeping blame out of it will keep them from getting defensive.</p>\n<h2>Let Them Know You Love Them</h2>\n<p>When you tell your spouse that you want to go to have therapy talk, they might think it&#8217;s because you don&#8217;t love them anymore.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a common association to make. Many couples only try marriage counseling when <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/divorce-grownups/200904/marriage-counseling-and-the-decision-divorce\">one of them wants a divorce</a>.</p>\n<p>Affirm your feelings with your spouse. Let them know that you want to see a counselor because you love them, not because you don&#8217;t.</p>\n<h2>Move Past the Stigma</h2>\n<p>For all of its benefits, &#8220;counseling&#8221; is still a dirty word to a lot of people.</p>\n<p>Some people think that if they see a counselor, it means there&#8217;s something wrong with them. Similarly, if they need a marriage counselor, there&#8217;s something wrong with their marriage.</p>\n<p>But a marriage counselor can be a preventative measure too. They can help give you the tools to offer <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/test/\">emotional support</a> to your spouse so you can avoid bigger problems later on.</p>\n<p>Tell your spouse of strong couples you may know who went to marriage counseling. Help them see that it&#8217;s not just for broken marriages.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t Get Defensive When They Get Defensive</h2>\n<p>When you mention counseling to your spouse, they may get defensive.</p>\n<p>This is normal. They might feel like you&#8217;re trying to blame them for not having a good marriage. They may be projecting experiences from the failed marriages they&#8217;ve seen around them onto you.</p>\n<p>As much as you want to defend yourself from their accusations, don&#8217;t do it.</p>\n<p>Getting defensive back at them can exacerbate communication problems and escalate the conflict unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>Stay calm, and keep things from getting heated.</p>\n<h2>Be Clear With Your Motives</h2>\n<p>Some people feel like the only way they can get their spouse to counseling is to trick them. They might say they&#8217;re going to meet with friends, only to ambush them in a counselor&#8217;s office.</p>\n<p>As desperate as things get, DO NOT do that.</p>\n<p>If there are any underlying trust issues in the relationship, that will only make it worse.</p>\n<h2>Set Clear Goals</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest reasons people quit therapy is because they don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://themighty.com/2017/06/should-i-stop-therapy/\">accomplishing anything</a>.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re still fighting about the same issues &#8211; what&#8217;s the point? Why are we wasting all this money?</p>\n<p>Progress is not linear. Especially when you&#8217;re dealing with therapy.</p>\n<p>Marriage counseling is not a cure-all to fix your marriage instantly. It&#8217;s a way to get the tools you need to work through conflicts together.</p>\n<p>But knowing that doesn&#8217;t always help us from feeling like counseling is ineffective.</p>\n<p>Set clear goals with your spouse of what you want out of counseling. Decide on some metrics and benchmarks that you can point out to prove that things are getting better.</p>\n<p>It might be days without a fight, durations of fights, frequency of <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-stay-physically-intimate-when-your-life-gets-busy/\">physical intimacy</a>, or any other metric you choose.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s important to set these goals with your spouse.</p>\n<h2>Choose A Counselor Together</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s not unusual for one spouse to want to see a counselor before the other.</p>\n<p>But this can create a dynamic with the reluctant spouse that they&#8217;re just doing &#8220;whatever you want, dear.&#8221; They&#8217;re just going along with it.</p>\n<p>Give your spouse as much agency in the process as you can-especially when choosing a counselor.</p>\n<p>If you choose a counselor on your own, it could feel like you and your counselor are ganging up on your spouse.</p>\n<h2>Let Them Make the Decision For Themselves</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s an old saying about horses and water and making them drink.</p>\n<p>If your spouse is reluctant to go to counseling, they might agree to go to appease you. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that they actually have any interest in examining the relationship themselves.</p>\n<p>No matter how much you want to go to couples counseling, make sure to communicate with your spouse that they don&#8217;t have to do it. And not in a manipulative way, either.</p>\n<p>Let them make their own decision. It&#8217;s much better to see a counselor later than you wanted when they are more cooperative than to get a stubborn spouse there as soon as you suggest it.</p>\n<h2>Having the Therapy Talk</h2>\n<p>Suggesting marriage counseling to your spouse can be an intimidating ordeal. This is especially true if you don&#8217;t know how they will respond-or maybe even if you know exactly how they&#8217;ll respond.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t let that fear stop you from making the right move for your marriage.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

Are you and your significant having trouble communicating or trusting each other?</p>\n<p>Before you throw in the towel, try to repair your relationship back to its healthy state. Studies show that couples therapy is effective at restoring a relationship <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/in-it-together/201712/couples-therapy-does-it-really-work\">75 percent</a> of the time.</p>\n<p>Going into your first session of couples counseling can feel intimidating at first. Here&#8217;s what to expect in couples therapy and how it actually works.</p>\n<h2>Reveal Basic Information About the Relationship</h2>\n<p>Wondering what to expect from couples counseling? The first session is spent learning more about each individual person and your relationship as a couple.</p>\n<p>Is important that your therapist or counselor gets to know each of you on a personal level. They can ask about everything from your childhood to how you met each other.</p>\n<p>While these facts may seem insignificant to you, they are important to understanding your whole story.</p>\n<p>Many people get discouraged after the first session is just a bunch of questions and there&#8217;s not a lot of actual therapy happening. Don&#8217;t worry, this is just so your therapist or counselor can get to know each of you.</p>\n<p>As your sessions continue, they will be more of what you expect.</p>\n<h2>Get to the Root of The Problems</h2>\n<p>There can be <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/7-signs-you-and-your-partner-could-benefit-from-couples-counseling/\">many different reasons</a> why you are trying couples counseling.</p>\n<p>Some of the most common reasons include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having the same arguments over and over</li>\n<li>Never fighting and ignoring the problems</li>\n<li>Physical intimacy problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not everyone&#8217;s problems will look the same, but identifying your specific problems is an important step.</p>\n<p>You may go into therapy thinking that your problem is all based on intimacy. But your therapist could soon discover that your relationship lacks trust and communication.</p>\n<p>As you share your concerns, your therapist will look for underlying, connecting themes.</p>\n<h2>Develop Goals and a Timeline</h2>\n<p>By pinpointing the root of your relationship problems, you can then develop your goals for therapy.</p>\n<p>Every couple&#8217;s goals will look different. Maybe you want to fall in love again or understand each other better. Some of your goals can focus on specific skills or just getting through a large adjustment together, such as a job change.</p>\n<p>A certain percentage of couples may decide that their goal is to end the relationship on a good note. Therapy can help you realize that your relationship is beyond saving and learn how to let go of it healthily.</p>\n<p>Remember that your goals can evolve over the course of your therapy. So your initial goal won&#8217;t necessarily be your end goal.</p>\n<p>Once you lay out your goals for therapy, you and your therapist will develop a timeline. This will happen once you already go through a few sessions and they get a better idea of where your relationship stands.</p>\n<p>Some couples only need a few months of therapy. Other couples may consider therapy a new part of their relationship.</p>\n<h2>Learn New Skills to Improve Relationship</h2>\n<p>What happens in marriage counseling? The most important aspect of marriage counseling is learning new skills that&#8217;ll benefit your relationship beyond the counseling sessions.</p>\n<p>Some of the most important skills in a relationship include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.marriage.com/advice/relationship/effective-relationship-communication-skills/\">Communication skills</a></li>\n<li>Patience and forgiveness</li>\n<li>Trust and honesty</li>\n<li>Selflessness</li>\n<li>Stress-management</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most couples have had all the essential skills at some point in their relationship but have just forgotten how to use them. Your therapy sessions will remind you of the importance of these skills and show you how they can improve your relationship.</p>\n<h2>Homework Outside of Sessions</h2>\n<p>Working on your relationship doesn&#8217;t stop once your therapy session ends. In fact, a major part of couples therapy is what happens in between the sessions.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll have tasks, or homework, to complete between each session. It&#8217;s important that you take your lessons seriously and complete these tasks if you want the counseling to work.</p>\n<p>Some of these homework assignments could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go out on a date without your phones.</li>\n<li>Get intimate with your partner.</li>\n<li>Keep a log of your emotions and any arguments that arise.</li>\n<li>Read a self-help book together and hold discussions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ultimate goal of this homework is to get you to a point where you can work out your issues on your own outside of therapy. You&#8217;ll start small with a few tasks but eventually, you&#8217;ll be able to tackle any issue that arises.</p>\n<h2>Attend Both Couple and Individual Sessions</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re still wondering what is couples therapy like, you may be surprised that it won&#8217;t always be as a couple.</p>\n<p>While couples sessions are the basis of the therapy, there are some things you need to work on by yourself. Often times, one of you has skills that the other needs to brush up on.</p>\n<p>Or one of you needs one-on-one time to work out trust issues from their past.</p>\n<p>Individual sessions are a possibility, but no couples therapy is successful with merely individual sessions. In order to be successful, you need to make sure both you and your significant other are committed to the sessions.</p>\n<h2>Beyond What to Expect in Couples Therapy</h2>\n<p>Now that you know what to expect in couples therapy, it&#8217;s time to improve your relationship. There&#8217;s no time like the present and you have nothing to lose.</p>\n<p>Want to start therapy but have limited time? Look into online relationship support.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/about/\">Our Relationship</a> offers an online program to develop communication skills and to reconnect as a couple. Through the online program, you&#8217;ll learn to trust each other again and watch your relationship thrive.</p>\n<p>Not sure what to pick? <a href=\"https://www.choosingtherapy.com/online-marriage-counseling-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ChoosingTherapy</a> has a useful review of the major options.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

Even though you&#8217;re devastated by it, you&#8217;re ready to give them a second a chance.</p>\n<p>But, you&#8217;re worried that you won&#8217;t be able to trust after cheating. Trust is the foundation to a healthy relationship, so what do you do when that foundation has been destroyed?</p>\n<p>You need to work as hard as you can to build that trust back up. How do you do that, exactly? It definitely won&#8217;t be easy. But, it is possible.</p>\n<p>In fact, according to recent studies, about <a href=\"https://www.divorcemag.com/articles/frequently-asked-questions-about-infidelity/\">60 to 75 percent of couples</a> stay together after infidelity. But, you don&#8217;t just want to stick out for the sake of sticking it out. You want your relationship to be the loving and trusting one it once was.</p>\n<p>How do you do this?</p>\n<p>Read on to learn how to regain trust after cheating.</p>\n<h2>1. Let Yourself Be Raw With Your Emotions</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, when someone is cheated on, they try to keep their emotions bottled inside of them, thinking that this is somehow &#8220;taking the high road&#8221;.</p>\n<p>While we certainly don&#8217;t condone screaming at your partner on the top of your lungs, it is important to wear your heart on your sleeve and make sure your partner knows exactly how you&#8217;re feeling about them cheating. Don&#8217;t be afraid to cry, grieve, and talk about your pain with your partner.</p>\n<p>Letting yourself be <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/150219-7-ways-to-let-yourself-become-more-vulnerable\">100 percent emotionally vulnerable</a> in front of your partner can help you break down communication barriers in your relationship.</p>\n<h2>2. Don&#8217;t Ignore What Happened</h2>\n<p>One thing that&#8217;s even worse than holding in your emotions is to ignore the issue completely.</p>\n<p>If you do this, there will constantly be an elephant in the room and you will never be able to rebuild your trust. And, you will never get down to the bottom of the underlying issue in your relationship.</p>\n<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t to say that you&#8217;re at fault for your partner cheating. However, there may be an issue that, if you addressed it, would make your relationship a million times stronger.</p>\n<p>Also, getting to the underlying issue can help you decide whether your partner is worth sticking with or not. For example, if they say the reason they cheated was because of something you did, and they try to shift the blame onto you entirely, it may not be worth fighting for your relationship.</p>\n<h2>3. Don&#8217;t Be a Helicopter Partner</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve all heard of helicopter parents. But, partners can be helicopters as well.</p>\n<p>Many couples make the mistake of thinking that building trust means watching your partner&#8217;s every move. As tempting as it can be to do this, this will actually end up destroying trust in the long run.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re checking your partner&#8217;s texts and emails, checking in with them a million times a day, tracking them on their phone, or engaging in any other behavior that involves keeping a close eye on them, you aren&#8217;t building trust. All you are doing is giving them a constant reminder that you, in fact, don&#8217;t trust them.</p>\n<h2>4. Stay Present and Future-Oriented</h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;ve been cheated on, it can be easy to fall into a routine of constantly living in the past, dwelling on the incident and pitying yourself because of what happened.</p>\n<p>But, this is not how you build trust after cheating. In order to build trust again, you need to make your best effort to focus on the present and future. Rather than focusing on what you or your partner could have done to prevent cheating, focus on what you can do now and in the future to make your relationship stronger.</p>\n<h2>5. Go to Counseling</h2>\n<p>One very practical solution to rebuilding trust in your relationship is to go to counseling.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, all it takes is an impartial third party to help you figure out how to get your relationship back on track. While talking to friends or family can be helpful, oftentimes, they end up being a negative influence. This is because they love you and hate to see you get hurt. Therefore, they have personal biases that will cloud their advice on the situation.</p>\n<p>Plus, sometimes it just helps to have your feelings heard by someone who isn&#8217;t your partner. Many couples who have happy, healthy relationships go to counseling too. There&#8217;s no reason to feel embarrassed about seeing a professional.</p>\n<h2>6. Trust Yourself</h2>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t trust yourself, you are never going to be able to trust your partner.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, the partner who was cheated on starts developing doubts about themselves. If you find you&#8217;ve been asking yourself questions like, &#8220;Should I have done something different?&#8221; or, &#8220;Should I have seen this coming?&#8221;, then you need to take a step back.</p>\n<p>Remind yourself that you&#8217;re smart, you can trust your own feelings, and that you&#8217;ll be okay moving forward. Also, it&#8217;s important to remind yourself that if your partner cheated again, you could survive it.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s only when you have full trust in yourself that you can have full trust in your partner.</p>\n<h2>7. Communicate About Communication</h2>\n<p>In a lot of cases, couples who have been through cheating had communication issues before the cheating happened.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t to say poor communication is an excuse to cheat, but excellent communication can help <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/about/\">strengthen your relationship</a>. While there&#8217;s a lot of argument out there about why cheating occurs, usually it has to do with one partner feeling like their needs weren&#8217;t being met.</p>\n<p>So, when talking about the cheating incident, address why there was a communication problem and what both you and your partner are going to do to solve it. Sometimes, saying something as simple as, &#8220;You can always tell me when something about our relationship is bothering you,&#8221; is enough to strengthen your communication.</p>\n<h2>Trust After Cheating: Time to Build It Back Up</h2>\n<p>Building trust after cheating is a lot of work, but it can be done if you follow the tips outlined in this article.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

But there is something even harder than breaking up. That is knowing when to break up.</p>\n<p>It is understandably difficult to admit to yourself when it is over. This is someone with whom you have spent a significant chunk of your life.</p>\n<p>There is not just the relationship itself. There is all of the effort and time the relationship represents. All of these things give more motivation to stick in something that is not working than to end it.</p>\n<p>How can you approach this decision with clear eyes? What are the signs your relationship is over? You do not want to do this lightly, so the signs better have weight.</p>\n<p>We have found five signs we believe are among the best indicators that your relationship is over. Read on, and see if you can use them to diagnose your own relationship troubles as temporary or terminal.</p>\n<h2>5 Clear Signs Your Relationship Is Over</h2>\n<p>Before we begin, a couple disclaimers.</p>\n<p>You will not see &#8220;a lack of communication&#8221; on this list. Communication underlies almost every aspect of a romantic relationship, and we all know this. We do not think it is necessary to waste your time telling you something you already know.</p>\n<p>You will see communication difficulties on this list, but we have made them as specific and identifiable as possible.</p>\n<p>Also, please know this about a failing relationship. Just because it has soured does not mean it is spoiled.</p>\n<p>You still have the benefits of all the time and energy you put into your relationship. We do not just mean the memories. You have grown from this relationship, no matter how bad it feels now, and it is important that you honor your own experience and growth.</p>\n<p>If, after seeing these signs, you decide that your relationship is over, do not consider it a failure. Just because something expires does not make it worthless.</p>\n<p>Now that we have gotten that out of the way, see below the signs for yourself. It is time to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/faq/\">answer your questions</a> about unhealthy relationships.</p>\n<h3>1. You Have Stopped Making Plans for the Future</h3>\n<p>There is a lot of talk about how much work it takes to be in a relationship. There is truth to this, but it is also overblown.</p>\n<p>Your relationship should be a joy. You should take interest in your partner&#8217;s interests and see them as the infinitely complex person they are. There is always more to discover about another person with whom you are intimate, and you should jump at the chance to discover all you can about them.</p>\n<p>Shared experiences are one of the ways couples get to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/the-importance-of-sharing-experiences/381493/\">know each other more deeply</a>. These experiences do not have to be epic. They can be as simple as exploring new areas of your city together.</p>\n<p>If you and your partner have stopped planning these kinds of experiences, that is a big red flag. It is likely that one or both of you find it difficult or uncomfortable spending too much time together.</p>\n<p>If you do not work through that difficulty and discomfort, it only grows. If you avoid future plans, it is time to take a look at what is wrong in the present.</p>\n<h3>2. You No Longer Argue</h3>\n<p>Fighting all the time is awful. Never fighting might be even worse.</p>\n<p>There is a kind of passivity that can settle into a relationship, especially in cohabitation. When you live with someone, it is important to pick the issues that are most important to you. Dishes, for example, are rarely the hill to die on.</p>\n<p>That said, neither of you should be so agreeable as to erase your personality. This breeds unfamiliarity, and unfamiliarity breeds contempt.</p>\n<p>When you spend all of your time pretending everything is fine, you lose the authenticity that feeds a healthy relationship.</p>\n<h3>3. Death by a Thousand Cuts</h3>\n<p>This is another bad model for disagreements. Big fights can be healthy for a relationship. They help partners clarify their values and express their love for each other, if they argue productively.</p>\n<p>Unproductive arguments are those that occur over tiny infractions. When pet peeves start to pile up, it is easy to look for any excuse to get into an argument. You may not even recognize you are doing it.</p>\n<p>If this is happening constantly, you may want to evaluate the underlying issues. Are the socks on the floor the real problem, or do you feel disrespected? If the latter, why do you feel uncomfortable addressing that?</p>\n<h3>4. Boredom Has Set in</h3>\n<p>The opposite of love is not hate. It is boredom. At least love and hate are strong feelings.</p>\n<p>Boredom, on the other hand, means you do not even care enough to think about the other person. This ties into making future plans. If you do not have the interest even to schedule dates, why are you two dating?</p>\n<h3>5. You Can&#8217;t Remember the Last Time You Touched</h3>\n<p>The loss of physical affection is one of the clearest outward signs that something is wrong in a relationship.</p>\n<p>This does not just mean sex, although a dip in the amount of sex you are having is certainly not a good thing. But it can be simpler and subtler than that.</p>\n<p>A relationship should be full of small physical gestures. Kisses, holding hands, gentle touches on the arm, leg, and back are all signs of care. If these start to go, it&#8217;s a sign something deeper has faded as well.</p>\n<h2>What to Do When the Damage Isn&#8217;t Done</h2>\n<p>Ending a relationship can be a traumatic experience, but it can be a productive trauma from which it is possible to rebuild. If it needs to be done, it is best to start that rebuilding process as soon as possible. Hopefully, reading these signs your relationship is over have helped you assess your own situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

There are many ways an individual can be unfaithful, though, including emotional cheating.</p>\n<p>Emotional cheating is highly common. In fact, the results of one study showed that <a href=\"https://www.fatherly.com/health-science/emotional-affair/\">78.6 percent</a> of men and 91.6 percent of women had admitted to an emotional affair at some point in their relationship.</p>\n<p>Is there a possibility that your partner is cheating emotionally? Are you unsure of the signs or how to address the issue without sacrificing your relationship?</p>\n<p>Read on to learn more about emotional cheating and how to handle it in your relationship.</p>\n<h2>What is Emotional Cheating?</h2>\n<p>In order to understand emotional cheating, it&#8217;s important to first understand the difference between emotional and physical affairs. There are some key differences between the two, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical affairs involve a partner engaging in sexual intimacy with another person.</li>\n<li>Emotional affairs often do not involve physical intimacy. Sometimes, the two people never meet in-person.</li>\n<li>Emotional affairs involve sharing intimate thoughts and feelings, often thoughts and feelings that are not shared with the person&#8217;s partner or spouse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Essentially, during an emotional affair, one person develops intimate feelings for someone besides their partner or spouse. They may even fall in love with that person.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that both physical and emotional affairs are devastating to a relationship. In many cases, though, people report feeling <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5864149/Is-emotional-affair-worse-physical-one-relationship-expert-weighs-in.html\">more upset</a> by an emotional affair than a physical one.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics of an Emotional Affair</h2>\n<p>How do you determine whether your partner is actually having an emotional affair or has just struck up a strong friendship with another person? Are you being paranoid, or are they actually engaged in emotional cheating?</p>\n<p>There are three characteristics that define emotional cheating:</p>\n<h3>Secrecy</h3>\n<p>If an individual is engaged in an emotional affair, they will likely keep their relationship with the other person a secret. They might delete texts or emails or hide their phone from their partner.</p>\n<h3>Deceipt</h3>\n<p>Deceipt involves intentionally deceiving one&#8217;s partner to prevent them from learning about the emotional affair. Lying about where you&#8217;ve been, where you&#8217;re going, or whom you&#8217;re speaking to is common during an emotional affair.</p>\n<h3>Betrayal</h3>\n<p>Betrayal occurs when you begin to do things with someone else that you wouldn&#8217;t do with your partner.</p>\n<p>This might mean sharing information or important stories that you&#8217;ve never told your partner or engaging in activities you&#8217;ve never engaged in with your partner.</p>\n<h2>Signs Your Partner is Cheating Emotionally</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, emotional cheating can be harder to spot than physical cheating. The individual involved in the affair may be fully present physically.</p>\n<p>On the surface, everything might seem fine. Your partner is returning from work on time, participating in family activities, and seems generally happy. But, they might also be presenting some questionable behaviors you might not have noticed.</p>\n<p>The following are some common signs of emotional cheating that you ought to look out for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spending more time than usual on their phone or computer</li>\n<li>Working more than usual</li>\n<li>Developing a new love for social media</li>\n<li>Asking for more space or alone time</li>\n<li>Asking questions about the relationship ending, especially during fights or arguments</li>\n<li>Getting defensive or evasive when asked about their relationship with another person</li>\n<li>Constantly talking about a new friend or coworker</li>\n<li>Changing their appearance or style</li>\n<li>Being overly critical about the other partner&#8217;s appearance or behavior</li>\n<li>Projecting their insecurities and accusing the other partner of cheating</li>\n<li>Changes in sexual intimacy</li>\n<li>Turning to someone else after a hard day or difficult event</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, one or two of these signs aren&#8217;t necessarily a guarantee that your partner is engaged in an emotional affair. But, if you notice several of these signs, they may be pointing to something more serious.</p>\n<h2>What to do About Emotional Cheating</h2>\n<p>If you find that your partner is engaged in an emotional affair, it&#8217;s easy to feel overwhelmed and unsure of what to do.</p>\n<p>Do you bring it up? Do you pretend it&#8217;s not happening? Do you need to end the relationship?</p>\n<p>Everyone handles these kinds of issues differently. But, the following steps can help you take control of the situation:</p>\n<h3>How to Confront Your Partner</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s normal to feel angry or want to confront your partner in a dramatic way after you learn about an emotional affair. That&#8217;s typically not the best approach, though.</p>\n<p>Give yourself a day or two to let your emotions settle. Then, set aside time to speak to your partner privately.</p>\n<p>During the conversation, focus on your feelings and use &#8220;I&#8221; language so your partner doesn&#8217;t feel attacked or a need to get defensive.</p>\n<h3>Repairing Your Relationship</h3>\n<p>After talking to your partner, you&#8217;ll need to decide where you want to go from here. Do you want to continue the relationship, or do you want to part ways?</p>\n<p>If you do decide that you want to save the relationship, consider working with a couples therapist.</p>\n<p>Whether you <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/about/\">see a therapist online</a> or in-person, they can help you identify the issues that led to the affair and strengthen your relationship.</p>\n<h3>How to Protect Your Relationship Against Future Cheating</h3>\n<p>If you do decide to seek counseling to repair your relationship, remember that it&#8217;s also important to protect it against future cheating (emotional or otherwise). Some steps you can take to do this include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work on building shared friendships and interests</li>\n<li>Work on improving your communication skills</li>\n<li>Return to the beginning of your relationship and remember why you fell in love in the first place</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These aren&#8217;t the only safeguards against emotional cheating, of course. But, they&#8217;re a good starting point.</p>\n<h2>Get Help with Your Relationship Today</h2>\n<p>Do you suspect your partner of emotional cheating? Have you noticed signs of an emotional affair?</p>\n<p>If this is going on in your relationship, it can be hard to know where to turn to get the help you need. In many cases, though, couples counseling is the first step to repairing your relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

You can probably hear Ross&#8217;s voice ringing through your head now!</p>\n<p>But in reality, taking a break from a relationship is no joking matter. In fact, many people feel they don&#8217;t work and lead to an actual break up.</p>\n<p>Yet, that&#8217;s not true.</p>\n<p>There are ways of taking a break that can lead to the kind of clarity and understanding a troubled relationship needs to survive. Let&#8217;s look into the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of pausing your relationship.</p>\n<h2>Do: Be Honest About Why</h2>\n<p>Before deciding to put your relationship on pause, it&#8217;s important to understand why you feel this way.</p>\n<p>You may have reached an impasse in the relationship and need to take a step back to refocus. Or a potential deal-breaker has come up and you need time to think.</p>\n<p>Whatever you identify the issue to be, that&#8217;s the time to set down <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">with your partner</a> and talk it through. Be open and honest with them. And listen to what they have to say.</p>\n<p>Above all, don&#8217;t request a break in the middle of anger or frustration. It&#8217;s a big decision to make. And one that both of you need to discuss and decide on together.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t: Take a Break If You Want to Break up</h2>\n<p>Many people decide to take a relationship break to avoid the messy situation of actually breaking up. But taking this slow-motion approach will only be harder on the both of you.</p>\n<p>If you know you want to break up, it&#8217;s best to confront the situation head-on.</p>\n<p>It may suck to think about hurting your partner. And the thought of being alone again is scary. But taking a break will only prolong the inevitable.</p>\n<p>Breaking up now, when you know it&#8217;s what you want, will let the healing process begin. Not only for yourself but your partner as well. And you both deserve that much.</p>\n<h2>Do: Set Boundaries</h2>\n<p>Once the both of you have talked, and you agree taking a break is best, it&#8217;s time to set some boundaries. Because running into confusion and a hurtful situation down the road will not help anything.</p>\n<p>But the boundaries may look quite different for each couple. It&#8217;s all in what you feel comfortable with.</p>\n<p>Will you still consider yourselves in a relationship during the break? Or will you be officially single during this time frame? Then you may want to discuss if you&#8217;ll date or sleep with other people.</p>\n<p>Be very careful, and crystal clear, in deciding what is acceptable and what is not. You both need to feel secure and have an understanding. Not only for your break but in the relationship that may follow it.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t: Communicate During a Break</h2>\n<p>A break means exactly that. And that includes taking a break in communication.</p>\n<p>When you suddenly find yourself without someone who has taken up a big part of your life, it&#8217;s natural to feel a void. And in turn, it&#8217;s natural to keep going back to this person.</p>\n<p>But you need this break to clear your mind and reflect. Having regular communication or even checking in with your partner will only muddy things up.</p>\n<p>Use this time apart to gain insight into yourself, your partner, and your relationship. And to do that successfully, you&#8217;ll need space without interruption.</p>\n<h2>Do: Set a Realistic Time Frame</h2>\n<p>Taking a break in a relationship without an end in sight may create turmoil and anxiety. And in reality, an open break is a breakup. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a good idea to set a time frame.</p>\n<p>Make it a time frame that both of you feel comfortable with. You may feel a week is enough time apart. Or you might need a month.</p>\n<p>Just be sure to respect that time frame once it&#8217;s set. You may go half-way through and know you want to stay with your partner. But they may need more time.</p>\n<p>Seeing the time frame through will ensure everyone gets the space they need.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t: Focus Solely on Your Partner&#8217;s Needs</h2>\n<p>Sure, a break is a time to reflect on your relationship and your partner&#8217;s needs. But don&#8217;t forget about yourself in the process.</p>\n<p>Your needs and well-being are important. So <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/individuals/\">use this time for YOU</a>!</p>\n<p>Spend time on hobbies you enjoy. Reach out to family and friends. And getting <a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/6-workouts-that-make-you-feel-good-when-youre-having-the-worst-day-ever-5540221\">physically active</a> will release &#8220;feel good&#8221; hormones that can help you get through this difficult situation.</p>\n<p>Taking care of yourself throughout a relationship break will give you the self-confidence to make the right decision.</p>\n<h2>Do: Ask Yourself the Important Questions</h2>\n<p>While you&#8217;re taking time to focus on yourself, it&#8217;s also the time to start facing the important questions.</p>\n<p>Are you seeing things clearly from both sides and understanding your partner&#8217;s concerns? Are you putting the kind of effort into the relationship you should be? Or are you pointing fingers and <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/5-steps-to-stop-blaming-o_b_7837134\">placing blame</a>?</p>\n<p>The time you spend alone while taking a break will also leave you with other questions to answer.</p>\n<p>Are you happier without your partner around? Can you not imagine a future without them? Or are you hanging on because you don&#8217;t want to be alone?</p>\n<p>Asking yourself the hard questions will get you down to the nitty-gritty part of your feelings. The part that will lead you to make a decision about your relationship that&#8217;s best for both involved.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t: Set Unrealistic Expectations</h2>\n<p>Nobody and no situation is perfect. So setting unrealistic expectations on your relationship and your partner will only be setting yourselves up for failure.</p>\n<p>Realize every relationship takes work. Mistakes are going to happen and feelings are going to get hurt. But it&#8217;s how much of yourself you&#8217;re willing to invest in this relationship that will dictate the outcome.</p>\n<p>Be realistic about each of your needs and weaknesses. Be honest about the role each of you plays. And know to start fresh, you need to set expectations that create a relationship worth fighting for.</p>\n<h2>Taking a Break Provides Relationship Clarity</h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;re in the midst of a murky relationship, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with wanting to take a step back to see things more clearly. In fact, taking a break may provide the exact clarity you need. Only then will you be confident enough to know how to move forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

Most couples want more sex in general. Figuring out how to get the spark back is often a matter of conquering the ego.</p>\n<p>There is hope for any couple out there struggling to return to their early days of regular intimacy. It&#8217;s going to take some self-reflection, dedication, and consistency. The solution may even be found outside the relationship.</p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s take a look at some practical solutions to find the lost spark in a relationship. Here are our top picks for steps that you can take today to reignite that sexual fire.</p>\n<h2>More Romantic Dates</h2>\n<p>After the first few years, most couples start to become less interested in dating. It&#8217;s this complacency that waters down the level of romance between each other. Don&#8217;t settle for mediocre for the sake of convenience or laziness.</p>\n<p>Plan a night out every week to go on a date and end with a night of sex. Give your partner something to look forward to every week. Reward them with a little pampering and you&#8217;ll soon get those juices flowing again.</p>\n<h2>Explore Your Partner&#8217;s Needs</h2>\n<p>Communication is the backbone to any healthy relationship. Sexual needs often take the back burner for topics of discussion, unfortunately. <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">Couples therapy</a> is often misinterpreted as only something for relationships on the rocks.</p>\n<p>The truth is, if you can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t talk about each other&#8217;s needs, then maybe someone else can. In fact, you may not even know that your partner craves more sex, a particular type of sex, and more exploration. If you can&#8217;t flat-out ask them, then consider other avenues to start the conversation.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t Fear the Kink</h2>\n<p>BDSM, poly, and pansexual adventures can transform the entire relationship. It isn&#8217;t just about the sex itself, either. Couples that are more open to trying new experiences, <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/couples-sex-tips-relationship-rules\">stay together longer</a>.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t know where to start? Ease into the kinkier lifestyles by joining Facebook groups together and starting a conversation. BDSM and poly couples that have a lifetime of experience together will make your kinky fun safe and enjoyable.</p>\n<h2>Sexual Health</h2>\n<p>Addressing any underlying conditions that prevent you from having sex normally is key. Ignoring these problems or hiding them from your partner is selfish. Common conditions like erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, or inability to orgasm are treatable.</p>\n<p>You have to diagnose the source of these sexual problems or they will only get worse. ED can be treated with medications or a complete lifestyle change. Remember, <a href=\"https://www.self.com/story/how-stress-affects-sex-life\">stress affects many aspects</a> of our sexual health, for men and women.</p>\n<p>Men struggle with performance, while women lose libido or the ability to orgasm altogether. Discuss this with your partner and start taking back your sex life.</p>\n<h2>Sweat it Out</h2>\n<p>Speaking of a healthy lifestyle, partner exercise sessions can enhance sex drive and performance. Exercise helps get those endorphins going, improving your mood, desire, and confidence. Do a round of exercise in the morning, get the blood pumping, and end with a romp.</p>\n<p>The increase in circulation will increase pleasure, intensity, hardness, and stamina for both parties. The sweat also ads to the experience, as our natural pheromones trigger the inner-animal.</p>\n<h2>Warm-Ups</h2>\n<p>The physiological action that regular exercise provides is just one way to get things started. When you&#8217;re both sitting on the couch with nothing to do, kick things off with some foreplay. Taking things slowly allows you to enjoy the moment without having to worry about performance.</p>\n<p>Women, in particular, have a difficult time jumping straight into sex. Their bodies have multiple erogenous zones. If you&#8217;re just hitting one key, it takes longer to warm up the entire instrument.</p>\n<p>Plus, the act of worshiping and appreciating the entire body is an emotional experience. Men should also be more open to full-body foreplay. It&#8217;s a turn on for women to see their partner relaxed and confident with themselves.</p>\n<p>Next time, try using various foreplay activities to warm up. Don&#8217;t rush this activity, it should naturally progress into sex, not be an obstacle.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t Over-Analyze It</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re comparing your sex life to a magazine article in the grocery store, you&#8217;re setting yourself up for failure. Sexperts aren&#8217;t substitutes for counselors or doctors. Don&#8217;t abide by rigid numbers of &#8220;sex goals&#8221; or funky bedroom positions.</p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t purchase that sexual spark back, no matter how many trendy sex toys or items you buy. There are few exceptions, like if your partner has never owned a vibrator, but you have to work on core issues first. What you &#8220;should&#8221; do and what magazines suggest usually don&#8217;t line up.</p>\n<h2>Spunky Spontaneity</h2>\n<p>This last piece of advice is probably the one most uttered, but it&#8217;s still relevant. Spontaneous sex is the best sex. Period. Wake your partner up with sex. Walk behind them in the kitchen and bend them over.</p>\n<p>Do some covert public petting and touching. This is the type of stuff that keeps couples feeling young again. Combine this level of spontaneity with planned dates, getaways, and presents. Send your partner a text telling them to expect something when they get off to work.</p>\n<p>Add a naughty wink to your text and you&#8217;ve just revved up their engine for the rest of the day. Be creative with your surprises and your love life will be anything but routine.</p>\n<h2>Finding Out How to Get the Spark Back</h2>\n<p>Did our guide get ideas flowing through your head? We hope it has given you something to build upon. Whatever you do, don&#8217;t give up on a romantic relationship that has turned cold.</p>\n<p>People can change, they will learn how to get that spark back if they see you making an effort. It takes two to tango, but it might take a teacher to show them the steps. With our experienced couples counselors, you can save your relationship from fizzling out.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

It&#8217;s important that you dedicate time and put in the work to stay happy and <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/healthy-relationships.aspx\">keep your relationship healthy</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the best ways to build a strong relationship with your significant other is simply spending time together. There are great couples activities that can give you the opportunity to connect with each other.</p>\n<p>These activities can be exciting and active, but they can also be simple and relaxing. The important thing is that you are doing something together. Every new experience you share is an opportunity to learn something new about your partner.</p>\n<p>Below, we&#8217;re sharing a list of ten couples activities to inspire you and your partner to spend time together. Read on to learn more.</p>\n<h2>1. Take a Cooking Class</h2>\n<p>One of the best bonding activities couples can try together is a cooking class. When you are both learning something new, you have the opportunity to work together as a team and complement each other with your individual strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>A cooking class is a particularly good setting for this because you are receiving the instruction from someone else, rather than telling each other what to do. That could eliminate any potential for one of you to be controlling or to take on too much of the work.</p>\n<p>At the end of the class, you&#8217;ll have learned how to make a delicious meal. Each time you recreate it at home can be an opportunity to relive the happy memory of the class.</p>\n<h2>2. Read a Book</h2>\n<p>Reading a book may seem like something each individual does alone, but it can actually be one of the best activities to do as a couple. Think of it a little bit like a two-person book club. Select the same title to read, and pick a date that you both agree to finish it by.</p>\n<p>Once you have both finished reading the book, set up a time to discuss it together. You may be surprised at how much you have to say, and how quickly you get into an in-depth discussion of what you liked and what you didn&#8217;t like.</p>\n<p>Even if you don&#8217;t have the same opinion, have a common topic to discuss can be a great conversation starter.</p>\n<h2>3. Travel Somewhere New</h2>\n<p>As far as couple activities go, there is nothing better than experiencing something for the first time at the same time. Sharing a moment of pure discovery will naturally bond you and your partner together and help your relationship feel stronger.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/nomanazish/2018/01/22/five-reasons-why-travel-is-good-for-your-mental-health/#760165a35934\">Travel has lots of benefits</a>; going to a new place together will create opportunities for you and your significant other to share those novel moments.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to travel anywhere far or exotic either. A simple trip to a nearby town you&#8217;ve never been to or a new state can be just as special.</p>\n<h2>4. Get Active</h2>\n<p>Activities for couples that help your body stay healthy can also go a long way in keeping your relationship happy. When you and your significant other exercise together, you can feel good about the fact that you are doing something healthy for yourself as well.</p>\n<p>There are lots of options for couple&#8217;s exercise, so you can find the activity that works best for your dynamic. If you enjoy being competitive with each other, a sport like tennis could work well. On the other hand, if competing is usually a negative experience, you could do something much simpler, like going for a walk together or taking the same yoga class.</p>\n<h2>5. Talk It Out</h2>\n<p>Scheduling sessions for couple&#8217;s therapy is one of the most positive activities to do as a couple. A lot of people think that couple&#8217;s therapy is only relevant when they are fighting or when there is an issue that needs to be resolved.</p>\n<p>Even happy couples with no significant issues can <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">benefit from therapy</a>. It can improve communication, because some things are just easier to say with an objective person in the room.</p>\n<h2>6. Go Green</h2>\n<p>Improving your outdoor space with a flower or vegetable garden is one of the most rewarding activities for couples. You will be able to see the physical proof of the hard work that you&#8217;ve accomplished together. Planting and caring for a garden also shows that you&#8217;re willing to invest in something to make it better.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have the space for a garden in your own home, look into a local community garden and schedule time each week to visit together.</p>\n<h2>7. Help out in the Community</h2>\n<p>If you and your significant other are looking for activities for couples that will bring a deep sense of meaning to your life &#8211; and your relationship &#8211; consider volunteering together. Community organizations and nonprofits always have a need for helpers who are willing to dedicate their time and services.</p>\n<p>Volunteering to help those less fortunate also encourages reflection and appreciation, which can be beneficial to your relationship.</p>\n<h2>8. Get Season Tickets</h2>\n<p>Getting season tickets to experience something that you and your partner both love makes for one of the most fun couples activities. It could be a local sports team, a local theater, or a local concert series.</p>\n<p>The important thing is that it is recurring. Having a regular, standing date or reason to get out of the house is exciting, and it takes the pressure off of date night when you don&#8217;t have to think of something to do.</p>\n<h2>9. Visit a Museum</h2>\n<p>Every trip to a museum is an opportunity to broaden your perspective by learning more about others. That&#8217;s a skill set that is also very useful in a healthy relationship, which is what makes museum visits such valuable activities to do as a couple.</p>\n<p>Talking about and comparing your experiences in the space may also lead to other, broader conversations about the way you see and experience the world.</p>\n<h2>10. Take a Trip down Memory Lane</h2>\n<p>Reflecting on your relationship&#8217;s past is a helpful way to think about its future. One of the most fun couples activities for you and your partner could be to recreate a date you had from earlier in your relationship. Maybe you could go back to a restaurant you loved when you were first dating, or another place that was special to you early on.</p>\n<h2>Ready to Start Trying Couples Activities?</h2>\n<p>Bonding over a shared experience can open you and your partner up to sharing even more. Couples activities are helpful for all couples in any stage of their relationship, so let these ideas inspire you to spend more time together.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

After all, it&#8217;s the pinnacle of human experience, right? There&#8217;s no way anyone&#8217;s ever going to ask you to have sex and you&#8217;re going to say, &#8220;You know, I&#8217;m just not feeling it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But then you grew up, maybe had some kids, reality set in, and you realized that tonight, you were way too tired to do anything. Sometimes, it can seem hard to get the fires burning and get excited about sex again. If you&#8217;re looking for some ways to spice up your love life, read on for ideas.</p>\n<h2>1. Get Some Massage Oil</h2>\n<p>Massage oil is a beautiful thing, and it can do wonders for your sex life. A lot of the times, especially if you have children, things can get hectic. Finding the time to keep up a healthy sex life can feel like just another chore on the to-do list.</p>\n<p>One way to make things feel natural and sexy again is to break out some oil and offer to give your partner a massage. They will love the massage and the feel of the oil, and you&#8217;ll get to spend time touching them without any pressure to get it on immediately. The slow burn arousal will build up and make for an amazing, steamy night.</p>\n<h2>2. Get Chatty</h2>\n<p>One great way to build up excitement about having sex before anyone ever gets undressed is to talk it up. Dirty talk can be fantastic in the bedroom, but it doesn&#8217;t have to stay there. And if you&#8217;re shy about dirty talking in person, this can be an awesome way to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/reigniting-the-fire-how-to-talk-about-sex-with-your-partner/\">avoid awkward wording worries</a> and still get the thrill.</p>\n<p>Spend the day texting with your partner about what you want to do to them when you both get home. Tell them what you have planned and if you want to, maybe snap a sexy picture or two in the bathroom. Talking all day about what you&#8217;ll do when you get home will have you both wild for it by the time the day is over.</p>\n<h2>3. Ramp Up the Anticipation</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re going out for a night out, the getting ready part of the evening can be as seductive as the coming home. A part of the fun of sex is the anticipation &#8211; slowing down and taking the time to look and appreciate. So why not give your partner the opportunity to do that and then spend some time daydreaming about you afterward?</p>\n<p>While you&#8217;re getting ready for your night out, try putting on your clothes on last. Do your makeup, shave, or do your hair wearing only sexy underwear (or nothing at all). If your partner tries to enjoy the show early, shoo them off until after you get home when they&#8217;ll be drooling over you.</p>\n<h2>4. Make Out During the Commercials</h2>\n<p>Do you remember being a teenager and making out with someone and feeling like there was a time limit before someone caught you? The excitement of the time limit made everything all the more tantalizing. Playing this little game can bring some of that back into your love life.</p>\n<p>Sit down to watch a game or a show with your partner, and agree you can only make out during the commercials. When the show comes back on, you have to stop until the next commercial break. By the time the show is over, you&#8217;ll be raring to go, and we guarantee you&#8217;ll never enjoy the commercials so much.</p>\n<h2>5. Set Up Signals</h2>\n<p>If you ever took a freshman psychology class, you&#8217;ve heard of Pavlov&#8217;s dogs and classical conditioning. While it may sound strange to bring psychology into the bedroom, classical conditioning works as well with libido as it does with hunger. But instead of using food, we recommend leaving your partner sexy little signals.</p>\n<p>Get a pouch of red beads, small stones, or basically any small beautiful object. Give some to your partner and agree when they leave one somewhere for you, you&#8217;ll have sex within the next 24 hours. It&#8217;ll turn into a great way to ask for sex without saying &#8220;So&#8230; you wanna?&#8221; and you&#8217;ll get a thrill every time you find one of the signals.</p>\n<h2>6. Leave Love Notes</h2>\n<p>On the subject of leaving treats for your partner to find, whatever happened to the good old-fashioned love note? Cute texts are wonderful, and it&#8217;s nice to hear sweet nothings whispered in your ear. But there&#8217;s something nice about the time it takes to write out a note and the happy surprise of finding it waiting for you.</p>\n<p>Leaving love notes around for your partner to find can be a great way to add some new passion to your love life. Whether the note is sweet and romantic or too hot to handle, it&#8217;ll make your partner happy. And according to a study, <a href=\"https://thoughtcatalog.com/natalie-gontcharova/2016/03/science-says-if-youre-having-more-sex-than-your-friends-youre-also-a-happier-person/\">happy people have more sex</a>, which makes them happier &#8211; it&#8217;s the best kind of cycle.</p>\n<h2>7. Watch a Movie Together</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been a couple for a long time, you&#8217;ve probably had a movie date night. It&#8217;s nice to pick out a film together, get some popcorn, and snuggle into the couch to watch the story unfold. But for this date night, we have a suggestion for making things steamier: instead of watching a rom-com or thriller, try watching some porn.</p>\n<p>Yes, porn is ridiculous and has <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/lorynbrantz/9-unrealistic-expectations-bad-porn-leads-men-to-believe\">very little to do</a> with actual sex. But there is something undeniably sexy about watching other people get it on. So pick a flick you and your partner are both into, get the porn rolling, and see where the night takes you.</p>\n<h2>Find More Ways to Spice Up Your Love Life</h2>\n<p>Having good sex often is a key part of a happy life for many people. Using some of these ideas can bring passion back into your love life and remind you of what it felt like to fall in love with your partner the first time.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Relationships are complicated. Nobody goes into or comes out of one assuming they&#8217;ll be easy. And every relationship we go into brings entirely new factors into play. After all, even <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/individuals/\">understanding ourselves</a> can be a challenge sometimes.</p>\n<p>With so much to consider, how do we help to grease the wheels of our relationship so that it works better overall? A good place to start is with a thorough understanding of the importance of communication. With that in mind, join us today, as we bring you seven important roles communication plays in any relationship.</p>\n<h2>1. It Helps Strengthen Respect</h2>\n<p>Effectively communicating within a couple allows both parties to develop their respect for each other. The idea is simple: people are emphatic. They can understand on a very subtle level when something&#8217;s wrong.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also <a href=\"https://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/healthy-relationships/\">a sign</a> of a healthy relationship. When it comes to talking about what&#8217;s going on in your life, they understand more by what you don&#8217;t say than what you do. When you have something to say, whether it&#8217;s good or bad, you need to say it.</p>\n<p>Your partner may have insights you aren&#8217;t expecting, and going through it together will help to strengthen your bond. More than that, however, it indicates you respect them enough to be mindful of how this might affect them, and you&#8217;re honest enough to speak plainly. A lack of communication can have the opposite effect.</p>\n<h2>2. It Takes The Guesswork Out</h2>\n<p>Mark Twain said: &#8220;If you tell the truth, you don&#8217;t have to remember anything&#8221;. This is one of the biggest benefits of honest communication within a relationship.</p>\n<p>A healthy connection with someone doesn&#8217;t come from withholding and remembering a string of little lies. It comes from being transparent with them.</p>\n<p>Learning how to improve communication skills means you can go about your business, never having to worry about getting &#8220;found out&#8221;. Your relationship becomes simpler, leaving both of you less stressed and, ultimately, happier.</p>\n<h2>3. It Helps To Avoid Misunderstandings</h2>\n<p>As close as we may become with our partners, every relationship is made up of two unique people. And everybody has bad days.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we miscommunicate. Other times, we forget to say things that are important, and the intricate gears of our relationship get gummed up.</p>\n<p>Communicating helps to prevent miscommunications&#8211;it&#8217;s as simple as that. When we express ourselves to the people we love, fewer things go unsaid. We become more used to explaining concepts and ideas in a way other people understand.</p>\n<p>And, overall, the people we love come to expect the truth from us. This is a much healthier kind of relationship, and it takes the pressure off when you aren&#8217;t worried about saying the wrong thing.</p>\n<h2>4. It Builds Trust</h2>\n<p>Trust is <a href=\"https://www.wellandgood.com/good-advice/why-trust-important-relationship/\">one of those factors</a> in a relationship that is both important and more than a little time-consuming. It takes time to develop trust, as they say, and not without good reason. Without an intrinsic trust in the person you&#8217;re in a relationship with, you can&#8217;t let the relationship breathe enough to ever be able to grow.</p>\n<p>This kind of hard work is a big part of why many relationships fail in the long run. Both partners have to be consistently open with each other, communicating honestly. Better communication between you and your partner leads to more trust in each other, and better trust leads to more confidence.</p>\n<p>Effective communication techniques help to make you and your partner feel secure. Without that, it would be hard for any relationship to prosper.</p>\n<h2>5. It Lets Partners Support Each Other</h2>\n<p>Sometimes the best benefits are the simplest. Life can get difficult, and in dozens of unique and wonderful ways. When it does and we&#8217;re single, the result is that we usually have to live through it alone. Not in a relationship.</p>\n<p>The problem comes when we don&#8217;t communicate our hardships with each other. When you run into personal challenges, you need to make yourself available so that your partner can be there for you, even when it doesn&#8217;t seem like it. They can offer you a shoulder to lean on, which is great, but they&#8217;ll also get the benefit of knowing they were a part of your process.</p>\n<p>Remember: nothing can get better if your partner doesn&#8217;t know anything is wrong. If you can improve communication skills between the two of you, you&#8217;ll each be the support the other one needs.</p>\n<h2>6. It Helps To Grow Love Between Partners</h2>\n<p>Love is, and this is going to sound corny, a lot like a flower. You have to water it. When we let our communication go stale, our love can suffer from lack of nourishment.</p>\n<p>We can&#8217;t expect to continue earning love from someone if we stop communicating entirely with them. Sometimes the love in a relationship just dies down, and there&#8217;s nothing you can do to revive it.</p>\n<p>But, more often than not, what&#8217;s missing is honest communication. The kind that got you to fall in love in the first place. You have to be able to remind each why it was you fell in love.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re putting in the effort from both sides to keep the fires stoked, you run less risk of drifting apart.</p>\n<h2>7. It&#8217;s Great For Your Mood</h2>\n<p>One of the greatest gifts in any relationship is being able to express your genuine happiness to someone. When someone is genuinely happy and has a partner with whom their communication is sound, their happiness can be like an echo chamber.</p>\n<p>When you are honest and joyful about something in your life, that honest communication allows us to express our emotions. And, when we do that, that elation feeds into both parties.</p>\n<p>Sharing your happiness with someone, openly, sets a mood of happiness that helps to create more of the same. This is a healthier way to process our emotions and a natural booster for any relationship.</p>\n<h2>The Importance Of Communication In Your Relationship</h2>\n<p>People say all the time that communication is vital to any healthy relationship. What they don&#8217;t tell you is why. How many things hinge on you and your partner being able to say what you mean to each other. How it affects your mood, your love for each other, and even your day-to-day stress levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

But some factors can cause more bumps on the road than others. Finances, child rearing, or aging parents are just a few examples.</p>\n<p>If your relationship is on the rocks, are there ways to strengthen your relationship? Or is it time to break up and move on?</p>\n<p>According to researchers, a typical marriage only has a <a href=\"http://time.com/4575495/divorce-rate-nearly-40-year-low/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">50 percent chance of lasting</a>. But don&#8217;t give up! Divorce and separation are not the only options.</p>\n<p>There are ways you can save your relationship. Read on to find out how to strengthen your relationship and overcome challenges.</p>\n<h2>Train Your Mind</h2>\n<p>One of the most important ways to improve your relationship is to change your mindset. When you go through ups and downs, it can be easy to think negatively about each other.</p>\n<p>You need to change your mindset and focus on the positive. After all, you fell in love with your partner for a reason. That&#8217;s why you got together in the first place.</p>\n<p>Try to focus on your partner&#8217;s good qualities, not their negative traits. You could try writing them down and keeping the list close at hand. Then refer to the list when things aren&#8217;t going so well.</p>\n<p>It might surprise you how many positive qualities you can write down. It may help you to fall in love with them all over again.</p>\n<h2>Show Your Love</h2>\n<p>Being positive shouldn&#8217;t only stay in the mind.</p>\n<p>An important way to improve your relationship is to show your love. Be kind, affectionate, and use positive words. Make it a daily habit.</p>\n<p>Be generous with compliments and let your partner know how much you love and appreciate them. It might sound soppy, but these expressions of affection can help you treasure each other.</p>\n<h2>Make Your Partner Your Best Friend</h2>\n<p>A house needs a solid foundation to stay upright and weather the storms. Similarly, a healthy relationship needs a solid foundation of friendship. If you have this underlying friendship, it will help you get through problems more easily.</p>\n<p>Try to treat your partner in the same respectful manner as you treat your friends. Be kind and appreciate them, support them, and listen to them. And don&#8217;t forget to have fun together.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;d never disrespect your friend in a rude manner. S, why would you do it to your partner? You should actually treat your partner better than your friends, not the other way round.</p>\n<h2>Make Love, Not War</h2>\n<p>One key to the question &#8220;how to strengthen your relationship?&#8221; is physical intimacy. Getting physical is a natural, healthy part of a relationship.</p>\n<p>At the end of a long tiring day, you may not feel in the mood. But you should make time for it &#8211; it&#8217;s important. Put in that extra effort, and you&#8217;ll feel a lot closer to each other.</p>\n<p>A relationship without physical intimacy may lose emotional intimacy too. Without that personal connection, a couple may drift apart. They might even start to look elsewhere for that intimate connection.</p>\n<h2>Spend Time Together</h2>\n<p>How to strengthen your relationship? One important factor is time. You must spend a lot of time together to make it work.</p>\n<p>It can be difficult to stay connected, especially when you have a lot of other commitments going on. From work and kids to household chores and grocery shopping, it can be hard to make time for each other. But this effort can reap positive results.</p>\n<p>Try to keep things interesting too, or you may become bored. The so-called &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090429172241.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">7-year itch</a>&#8221; can cause a break in a relationship.</p>\n<p>When you first got together, you no doubt did exciting things. Go out on dates, plan weekend getaways, or spend cozy nights away from the kids. As you draw closer to each other and enjoy the time you spend together, your bond will become stronger.</p>\n<h2>Discuss, Don&#8217;t Fight</h2>\n<p>Disagreements are inevitable in any relationship. But instead of letting them turn into a full-blown fight, try to discuss the matter calmly. That&#8217;s easier said than done, but practice makes perfect.</p>\n<p>Try to keep the discussions short and sweet. When disagreements surface and you repeat arguments over and over, words can start to get nasty. You may not be able to come up with a solution at the time, so take a break and come back to the matter a little later.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t play games with each other&#8217;s feelings, such as using the silent treatment, as it will only make matters worse. Try to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>Listen Carefully</h2>\n<p>Listen attentively to your partner and don&#8217;t be judgemental. This will help your partner see that their feelings are important to you.</p>\n<p>Being a good listener will not only help you discern their true feelings, but it can also allow your partner to open up freely. If they feel they&#8217;re being respected and valued, they are more likely to share their emotions.</p>\n<h2>Learn to Forgive</h2>\n<p>Be realistic about your expectations.</p>\n<p>When you experience problems in your relationship, you should not conclude that it was a mistake to get together in the first place. Remember that everybody makes mistakes. You can probably recall times you&#8217;ve made mistakes too.</p>\n<p>Instead of pointing the finger, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/individuals/\">take a look at yourself</a>. Accept that both parties will make mistakes. Resolve your differences and be forgiving.</p>\n<p>Letting it go and forgiving will have a positive effect on yourself too. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/forgiveness/art-20047692\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">researchers have found</a> that letting go of grudges can result in improved health and peace of mind.</p>\n<h2>How to Strengthen Your Relationship</h2>\n<p>One of the best ways to improve your relationship is to get professional help. But that&#8217;s expensive, isn&#8217;t it? Actually, there are programs that can help you for free.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Our Relationship&#8221; program can help you to solve relationship issues.

Though making a lifelong commitment and companionship were also highly valued as reasons to tie the knot.</p>\n<p>Marriage isn&#8217;t always easy. While the <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/10-most-common-reasons-people-divorce_b_8086312\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reasons why couples divorce</a> may vary, it often boils down to poor communication between two people. Sometimes it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t realize they&#8217;re both speaking different love languages. While your spouse may express themselves with touching, you may feel verbally expressing yourself is how you share love. Understanding love languages is a huge key to having a loving and fulfilling relationship that lasts.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to answer the question, what is my love language? Or if you just want to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">communicate better as a couple</a>, keep reading. We&#8217;ll help you determine what is your love language.</p>\n<h2>The Different Love Languages</h2>\n<p>In 1995, Dr. Gary Chapman wrote a book entitled, &#8220;The Five Love Languages&#8221;. Since then, the book has become more and more popular.</p>\n<p>Dr. Chapman believes that all five love languages should be incorporated into your relationship. However, to get the most out of your relationship, it&#8217;s important to focus on knowing what both you and your mate&#8217;s favorite action is to get the best reaction.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s learn about the five love languages.</p>\n<h2>1. Physical Touch</h2>\n<p>From the moment a child is born, mothers are encouraged to place their newborns on their chest. Babies are held in neonatal units.</p>\n<p>The need for physical touch doesn&#8217;t diminish as we get older. There are countless studies that show the <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-touching-your-partner-can-make-both-of-you-healthier#5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">physical and mental benefits</a> from being touched by others.</p>\n<p>Physical touch doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean over-the-top PDA that grosses out everyone else. Instead, it means holding hands, kissing, and hugging. It can even mean sitting close to your loved one.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a way for couples to feel connected and safe.</p>\n<p>However, not everyone grew up in a household where physical touch was a priority. But if they&#8217;re in a relationship with someone whose primary love language is physical touch, that person may end up feeling unloved, no matter how many gifts and words of love are used on them.</p>\n<h2>2. Receiving Gifts</h2>\n<p>Just because someone&#8217;s love language is receiving gifts, it doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re a gold digger or that they only crave materialistic things to feel valued and loved.</p>\n<p>It does mean that receiving something thoughtful and meaningful such as bringing them home their favorite candy bar after a tough week will make them feel appreciated and loved.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to go overboard and spend a ton of money, even small gifts make them feel as though they&#8217;re on your mind. This is one of the easier love languages to learn, especially if you didn&#8217;t grow up in a home where gift giving was a priority.</p>\n<h2>3. Acts of Service</h2>\n<p>The acts of service love language is different than the receiving gifts love language. You may recognize that your partner identifies with this love language if you hear them say that actions speak louder than words.</p>\n<p>Acts of service don&#8217;t have to be huge, grand gestures. Instead, something simple such as cooking your spouse their favorite meal, unloading the dishwasher or even picking up their dry cleaning are all perfect examples of acts of service.</p>\n<p>All of these actions are simple, but they require time, effort, and thought. It&#8217;s the time, effort, and thought that your loved one will appreciate the most.</p>\n<p>However, if you perform these acts out of a sense of obligation and/or make a big deal out of it, this love language will backfire on you. Instead, perform acts of service out of love and the desire to make the other person happy for best results.</p>\n<h2>4. Quality Time</h2>\n<p>The quality time love language is about giving someone your undivided attention. That means time spent with someone you love without your smartphone, the latest football game being on tv or any other types of distractions.</p>\n<p>While you can still curl up in front of the television together to watch something you both love, the main focus should be on dedicating time together with no distractions. No friends or family allowed.</p>\n<p>Doing so helps the person whose love language is quality time feel comforted and valued.</p>\n<p>However, if you&#8217;re prone to canceling or postponing this together time, it will hurt your partner. And it&#8217;s not enough to be with someone physically but not emotionally.</p>\n<p>Taking someone out to dinner and then chatting up your waiter while ignoring your loved one is not considered quality time. If you&#8217;re easily distracted, opt for quality time where there are few or no distractions such as taking a walk in nature together.</p>\n<h2>5. Words of Affirmation</h2>\n<p>Whoever said, &#8220;sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me&#8221; didn&#8217;t have words of affirmation as their primary love language. Words can and do hurt people.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to be Shakespeare or Cyrano de Bergerac to build up your partner. In fact, it&#8217;s often the shortest and simplest words that carry the most meaning.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re beautiful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That color looks incredible on you!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I love how good you are with our kids.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Little compliments and telling someone &#8220;I love you&#8221; goes a long way. But on the flip-side, rude, mean, insulting comments will tear down the person you love quickly.</p>\n<p>And it will be harder for that person to forgive (and forget) those horrible words you&#8217;ve used. Choose your words wisely if you love someone whose love language is words of affirmation.</p>\n<h2>Get Help With Your Relationships</h2>\n<p>Whether <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/individuals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">you&#8217;re single</a> or in a committed relationship, everyone deserves to have loving relationships with everyone in their lives. Learning how others express themselves and respond to love can vastly change your experiences with others. Understanding the different love languages can help you do that.</p>\n<p>We can help too.

These include trust issues, unmet expectations, and compatibility to name a few. Fighting consistently can also lead to a troublesome relationship, and if handled poorly, could end the relationship altogether. While fighting in a relationship is normal (no one is perfect!) there are ways to stop fighting and handle your conflict with poise and understanding.</p>\n<p>Fighting well takes time and commitment to get to the root of the problem no matter what it is. If you&#8217;re in a relationship where you find yourself fighting more than having fun with your significant other, rest assured, there are ways to stop fighting and enjoy each other more.</p>\n<h2>How to Stop Fighting in A Relationship</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re tired of fighting with your significant other, here are some ways you can halt it before it gets worse.</p>\n<h3>1. Dodge the Defensive</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s normal and natural to want to become immediately defensive when a fight erupts. You may feel attacked, wronged, or blamed for something you didn&#8217;t do. Taking criticism or statements from your partner as personal only adds fuel to the fire.</p>\n<p>But, objectively evaluating the situation is the best course. Did you say or do something causing hurt to them? If so, work to make it right.</p>\n<p>This could include apologizing, fixing what happened, or just asking how you can make it right. Often, it isn&#8217;t about you as a person, but what happened. Be receptive to what the other person has to say and internalize it, asking questions if you need to.</p>\n<h3>2. Step Away From the Situation to Cool Down</h3>\n<p>Often during a fight, our thoughts and emotions can become cloudy or irrational. Fighting in this mindset causes more discourse, as we typically say things we don&#8217;t really mean.</p>\n<p>If the argument becomes too heated, step away for a while and regain your perspective. Allow your mind to cool down by taking a walk or spending some time alone. Usually, you can approach the conflict with a renewed attitude once you clear your head.</p>\n<h3>3. Always Fight or Argue Face to Face</h3>\n<p>In our digital world, we can think before we text giving us an opportunity to control our conversation. But not everyone reads texts and tones the same way, and your partner could be taking what you &#8216;say&#8217; completely out of context, paving the way for more fighting.</p>\n<p>When people fight face-to-face body language is clearer and it&#8217;s easier to pick up on vocal tone. If an argument is especially complex or intesnse, long, drawn-out text messages are difficult to type out and are best discussed in person.</p>\n<h3>4. Create Boundaries for A Fight</h3>\n<p>Fighting becomes out of hand when you attack the person&#8217;s character instead of the problem itself. Swearing, yelling over each other, and avoiding the real problem can all mount and the fight becomes an all-out war.</p>\n<p>Sit down with your partner and discuss some boundaries for when you fight. For example, one person may speak first in a respectful tone with no yelling or name calling. These destructive behaviors redirect you from the issue needing attention and create an unsafe space for each other to feel heard and accepted.</p>\n<h3>5. Remember Why You&#8217;re in The Relationship</h3>\n<p>Though <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/8-physical-signs-youre-in-the-honeymoon-phase-of-a-relationship-9588418\">the honeymoon phase</a> of your relationship might be waning or completely over, it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a lost cause. Many people go on to have successful, deeply fulfilling relationships long after they&#8217;ve first started dating or after the first years of marriage.</p>\n<p>This could be because they remembered why they&#8217;re in the relationship and what they love about their partner. They realized their lives are better with each other than without. Though everyone has their baggage and personal problems, there&#8217;s good to remember and this gives the relationship something to fight for.</p>\n<h3>6. Take Care of The Conflict as Soon as Possible</h3>\n<p>Couples who allow problems to intensify break up sooner than those who approach conflict quickly. Not speaking up and letting our feelings simmer brews unspoken resentment or bitterness which could permeate the relationship.</p>\n<p>This is damaging, especially if the other partner does not know. Coming clean about our feelings or issues and laying it all out on the table forces us to work through those problems so there&#8217;s nothing weighing on our minds throughout the course of the relationship.</p>\n<h3>7. Consider Therapy</h3>\n<p>If the fighting seems too difficult to handle on your own, or you&#8217;re feeling lost, consider couples therapy.</p>\n<p>Couples who choose to receive therapy can learn to relate to and understand each other better, and themselves. Therapy gives you an opportunity for a third party to peek inside your relationship and identify problem areas you may overlook.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/faq/\">good therapist</a> provides practical steps to work towards peace in your relationship. They can offer techniques to help you work through arguments and disagreements. Couples therapy is a wonderful outlet to express your thoughts.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, therapy goes both ways. While the therapist or counselor aims to provide you with constructive feedback, it doesn&#8217;t work unless you both commit to saving the relationship.</p>\n<h3>8. Take Some Time Apart</h3>\n<p>The stresses of our lives can trickle into our relationships. While it could be that things outside of your relationships are causing you stress, it&#8217;s true the relationship itself is just stressful.</p>\n<p>Think about taking time apart from each other for a time. It could be a weekend alone or with friends just to enjoy someplace or something you love.</p>\n<p>Be encouraged at times couples need to spend time apart. This could be for various reasons completely individual to the couple. It&#8217;s not necessarily a sign the relationship is in trouble.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, time away provides you with a different perspective on your relationship. If you return believing the relationship is at an end, discuss it with your partner.</p>\n<h2>Stop Fighting and Start Enjoying Each Other</h2>\n<p>Every couple goes through rough patches but constant fighting in a relationship is tiring and draining. When you stop fighting, you enjoy your relationship &#8211; and each other &#8211; more. Take these steps to your next argument and learn to solve the conflict in a healthy and productive way.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>When the <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">two of you</a> first got together, you were inseparable. Your sexual chemistry was undeniable and you had a blast exploring each other&#8217;s bodies.</p>\n<p>But then, over time, things began to change.</p>\n<p>Your sexual activities went from a daily occurrence to a weekly or even monthly occurrence, and before you know it, you two haven&#8217;t touched each other in what feels like forever.</p>\n<p>Believe it or not, this is more common than you may think. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/contemplating-divorce/201512/is-why-many-couples-struggle-sex\">partners across both genders</a> reported feelings of sexual frustration and dissatisfaction.</p>\n<p>Of course, talking with a partner about sex can be difficult, especially if you&#8217;re already having issues.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t settle for an unhappy bedroom. Here are a few tips on how to talk about sex with your partner that can help you reignite the fire you thought was lost.</p>\n<h3>Shake off the Stigma</h3>\n<p>Be honest, you probably saw this headline and started to blush.</p>\n<p>From an early age, we&#8217;re taught that sexuality is something that should be hidden and never discussed. Suffice to say, that can lead to some pretty complicated issues down the road.</p>\n<p>But until you remove the stigma from sex, having an open, honest discussion with your partner will be quite a challenge.</p>\n<p>Talking sex, even with someone you love and trust, can be a bit embarrassing. But don&#8217;t pull away. The problem won&#8217;t go away if you don&#8217;t discuss it.</p>\n<p>Start framing sex like you would any other facet of your relationship. Despite what many of us are taught, it&#8217;s a healthy, normal part of life and should be treated as such.</p>\n<h3>Expect Some Discomfort</h3>\n<p>Because of the stigma, not everyone is comfortable talking about sex. Even if your sexual relationship with your partner is fine, they may become shy or timid anytime sex is mentioned.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s crucial that you respect your partner&#8217;s wishes while also stressing how important it is to you. Be careful not to come across as angry or accusatory.</p>\n<p>Instead, gently ask them why talking about sex makes them uncomfortable. Let them know that it hurts when they shut down and refuse to talk about it, and use this as a chance to open a dialogue.</p>\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a chance that you&#8217;re the more timid partner. If that&#8217;s the case, don&#8217;t feel guilty. Explore your feelings of discomfort and turn inward.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you had a religious upbringing that makes it difficult to explore your sexuality. With proper acknowledgment, you can work through those feelings.</p>\n<h3>Set Communication Ground Rules</h3>\n<p>Communication is at the heart of any healthy relationship, and it&#8217;s important that you&#8217;re always honest with your partner.</p>\n<p>With that said, talking sex with your partner can bring about some friction &#8230; and not necessarily in a good way. As a result, it may be a good idea to set some communication ground rules.</p>\n<p>First, agree to take the time needed to have such an important discussion. That may sound silly, but life can get so busy that it can be difficult to find time for such an important discussion. Both partners need to dedicate their full attention to the topic at hand.</p>\n<p>Next, watch how you speak to one another. If it gets heated, walk away for a few moments. Likewise, if both partners can&#8217;t stop blushing, agree to talk through it.</p>\n<p>Finally, don&#8217;t be afraid to express your needs. Let your partner know how important sex is to you. Tell them what you need to feel safe.</p>\n<p>Both partners should stick to a strict no-judgment policy throughout the discussion.</p>\n<h3>Practice Talking About Your Fantasies</h3>\n<p>One great way to become more comfortable talking about sex with your partner is to slowly tease out one another&#8217;s fantasies. We all have turn ons and turn offs, but we&#8217;re not always great about verbalizing our desires.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re struggling to talk about your fantasies, try using an <a href=\"http://mojoupgrade.com/\">online questionnaire</a>.</p>\n<p>Both partners separately fill out a few pages of basic information about their sexual interests based on a scale based on interest.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s great about this questionnaire is that it only shows you what you and your partner have in common, so you can answer openly and without fear.</p>\n<p>Go through the results together. What seems like a simple quiz can be used as a fantastic way to introduce some new kinks and fun into your sex life.</p>\n<p>This is a great example of why a no-judgment policy is a good idea, by the way. Both partners are likely going to learn some surprising things about one another, but judging is a surefire way to kill off any spark.</p>\n<h3>Approach the Situation as a Couple, Not as an Individual</h3>\n<p>Every problem you face is an opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/about/\">grow your relationship</a>. Start viewing each problem as you and your partner against the issue instead of you and your partner against one another.</p>\n<p>A lot of this will come through your phrasing. No one wants to feel attacked, so be conscientious about how you address the issue.</p>\n<p>Use inclusive language like &#8216;we&#8217; and &#8216;us&#8217; throughout your dialogue to avoid coming off as accusatory.</p>\n<h3>Make Time for One Another</h3>\n<p>Talking about sex is one thing, but making time for it is another. Time can be a leading cause for a lack of intimacy.</p>\n<p>But like any other facet of your relationship, it&#8217;s up to the two of you to make time for it.</p>\n<p>Send each other flirty texts throughout the day to keep each other excited and interested. Make more of an effort to engage in physical affection, too.</p>\n<p>If all else fails, try to stick to the five-minute rule. Even if you&#8217;re exhausted, spend five minutes at the end of the day kissing, touching, or being intimate with your partner.</p>\n<p>Even if you&#8217;re still not in the mood, <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/42198-what-is-oxytocin.html\">you&#8217;ll release oxytocin</a>, a chemical that helps you and your partner bond.</p>\n<h3>How To Talk About Sex with Your Partner: A Few Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Talking about sex isn&#8217;t always something that comes easily. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t important, especially if you and your partner are looking to reignite that long-lost flame that still burns inside.</p>\n<p>Looking for more advice on how to talk about sex with your partner? Or maybe you and your loved one are struggling with another issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",
