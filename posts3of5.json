      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Caitlin McNulty</strong></p>\n<p>Although general election years are always stressful in anticipation for our next president, the past couple elections have been especially emotionally charged due to the increased hostility among political parties and subsequent distain toward members of opposing groups. With politics being at the forefront of our daily lives, it is a common topic of conversation among romantic partners – which sometimes creates conflict when disagreement occurs. Here we’ll discuss how you can actively take steps to minimize political differences’ negative impacts and allow your relationship to continue to flourish by understanding how they can take a toll on your romantic relationship.</p>\n<p>When you and your partner disagree on political issues, you may feel strain and stress within your relationship. Political disagreement between romantic partners can generate doubts about your compatibility on core values and beliefs, making you feel less like a team and more like opponents. When you feel more emotionally distanced from your partner, you may feel less committed to the relationship, which could make you less affectionate and appreciative of your partner. However, it is extremely important to notice that these increases in stress are temporary and your relationship is not doomed to fail solely because you and your partner differ politically. It is also important to consider how much your differing political views weigh in your overall relationship satisfaction, which depends on how political you and your partner consider yourselves to be. If politics have not been a major factor in your decision to enter into a committed relationship with your partner thus far, you may be more willing to be in a relationship with someone of a different political affiliation than yourself without it causing relationship-threatening issues. However, if politics are a major component of your life and something you are not willing to agree to disagree on, it may be a more significant detriment on your overall relationship satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Because politics is currently taking over our country, it may be easy to conclude that this is the source of all your relationship problems. Research shows that you and your partner are less likely to argue over political issues or be significantly impacted by political stress if you have consistently invested time in maintaining a healthy relationship prior to election season. If you and your partner spend quality time together, lean on each other for support, actively communicate, do exciting things together, and have a healthy sex life, then differing political ideology should not outweigh all of those positive behaviors. Research shows that couples with differing political ideologies are no more likely to break up than couples with similar political ideologies. Therefore, you and your partner’s overall relationship satisfaction will lead to future relationship success or failure, not solely your differing political views.</p>\n<p>If you find political disagreement with your partner taking more of a toll on your relationship than you would like it to, you could benefit from changing your mindset and seeing your differing political views as an opportunity to expand your worldview and listen to a different perspective. As much as we would like to think we know exactly what is right, that may not necessarily be true. It could be both educational and healthy for your relationship to hear your partner’s opposing political view. Understanding that political issues are not as black-and-white as they seem to be in today’s world can make you more willing to actively listen and understand where your partner is coming from instead of dismissing their views as wrong and having conflict in your relationship. Having a mature conversation about your political views with your partner will positively maintain your relationship by streamlining communication and leading to mutual respect of opinions. It is okay – and even healthy – to realize that you and your partner, although complementary in many ways, are still two different people who grew up with two different life experiences and learned values. As long as you both respect each other’s opinions on political issues and make genuine effort in maintaining a healthy relationship overall, the current political climate should not shatter the entire relationship you have built to the ground.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Corinne Issa</strong></p>\n<p>With over 30 million Americans turning to online dating apps to find suitable partners each year—a number that continues to rise&#8211;it seems inevitable that, whether you want to just have fun or find “the one,” eventually you’ll venture into the cyber world to set up your own dating profile and review the profiles of prospective dates. So how should you go about presenting yourself in the best light? How can you interpret the information of potential partners? What are the largely unconscious factors that have induced you to swipe right or left? In the online dating world, it is important not only to address these questions, but also to fully understand your own responses when examining the profiles of potential partners: a thorough grasp of these elements will allow you to utilize some techniques that might make your experience a happier one.</p>\n<h2><strong>Choosing the Best Profile Picture</strong></h2>\n<p>First, you need to put some serious time and effort into your self-presentation, since it will become the primary strategy through which you can shape others’ view and impression of you. Photos that are more expansive, where the posture is open and the stance is wide, are more likely to invite a swipe to the right and increase the odds of making a successful romantic connection. An open stance conveys a sense of confidence, which is perceived as more attractive. Surveys show that potential daters rate smiling photos as more attractive than serious ones. In addition, the smile is an open invitation with its own message. A smiling person is less risky because the confidence he or she conveys indicates that person is friendly and happy. Since most relationships start with that first green light, the smile can produce a chain effect.</p>\n<p>Of course, you need to comment on that profile picture. When analyzing the attractiveness of texts (in the creation of a profile), it was found that more alluring written description went hand in hand with smiling photos: just as the smile conveyed confidence, so did the words. Of course, in writing for confidence, you should make sure you don’t overdo it; over-confidence actually indicates insecurity or self-absorption, two traits that are more likely to be dismissed with a swipe to the left.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Emoji as an Aid</strong></h2>\n<p>Even online, communication has to be at the “heart” of the dating experience. To maximize how you are perceived, disclose the greatest amount of information, and heighten the interest level in pursuing a relationship, you should consider using emojis as nonverbal cues. Emojis can succeed where simple text often fails in providing clearer intent and tone. Compared to a text chat, versions featuring more nonverbal cues through emojis produced more favorable perceptions of the potential partner and greater disclosure. In other words, a simple text exchange won’t completely cut it: you need emojis, like blowing a kiss, that send a clear signal. Emojis are expressive in showcasing nonverbal communication messages you would be sending if you were meeting a date in person.</p>\n<h2><strong>What Text Reveals</strong></h2>\n<p>An impression is formed on both sides not only through the picture, but also though the “decoding” of text in the profile or exchange. Studies show that people will infer personality traits (and therefore compatibility) by interpreting the language. Here’s where subtext can become a valuable tool both for the profile you present and the text exchange with the person you are checking out. According to Stephanie Tom Tong, professor of Communications at Wayne State University, your profile is crucial because it is the first and primary means of expressing oneself during the early stages of online dating. Your profile can therefore foreclose or create relationship opportunities. She urges the use of natural language to put the other at ease, since this linguistic information is the primary means of interpreting cues. As the sender and the observer, you have to examine your own profile for these subtle messages that might attract or repel potential partners, even as you look for the cues in those you seek to attract. Word length and choice, grammar, sentence length, and vocabulary are all useful tools in assessing personality. Be clear and use everyday vocabulary and be conscious and use correct grammar. Don’t be shy about including some humor; this trait was positively associated with openness to experience, agreeableness, and emotional stability. Words showcase your personality: use them to convey an attention to detail both for yourself and in interpreting the words of others.</p>\n<h2><strong>Take-home Message</strong></h2>\n<p>If you decide to dive into the online dating pool, keep in mind that you want to also attract the most promising partners and convey your own attractiveness to them. Since in-person non-verbal cues are missing from the cyber experience, make the most of the verbal and linguistic cues, including emoji’s, at your disposal. Create a compelling, open, and confident profile as a crucial means of making a first impression; attend to those subtle details that can say so much about your positive qualities. Look for the minute cues in the presentational messages of others to see if they also took care with the details. A possible partner’s well-written post indicates investment in the process and potentially in you. Likewise, a grammatically incorrect or poorly written post might indicate a lack of education or indifference to the process.</p>\n<p>Verbal and non-verbal components in online dating can tell an entire story about you and your dating prospects. But, with the level of anonymity involved, can you trust the process to be as revealing as we’ve outlined here? The answer to that question is a surprising “probably.” Notions that people frequently lie online is inaccurate. Now, if you opt to join the more than one-third of today’s dating couples who have formed online dating relationships, you can shape your profile and review the profiles of possible partners with the knowledge that you’ve optimized your chances for finding romance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Natalia Walcott</strong></p>\n<p>No matter how hard you try, there is no running away from stress. It can occur during any part of your day, whether it be while driving, working, running errands, or while with your partner, etc. Although you cannot always anticipate stress and prevent it from happening, you can control how you react to that stress. There is no reason to transfer your individual stress onto your partner and cause conflict when there was none to begin with. Relationships are not always easy and will present multiple challenges throughout their duration. It is important to recognize the signs that your relationship is being affected by multiple internal and external stressors. Here are a few signs to consider.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Both of You Are More Distant and Less Engaged With Each Other:</span></h2>\n<p>When you are stressed, you are unable to think clearly. You may lash out at your partner and be very dismissive. If you had a bad day at work and feel overwhelmed with stress, you are more likely to express feelings of irritability/ anger, withdrawal, and rejection towards your partner. At that point, you have allowed the stress from your job to spill over into your relationship. This type of negative behavior does not allow for proper communication as a couple and can lead to unnecessary arguments. The inadequate communications skills caused by your stress can lead to alienation from one another if it continues.</p>\n<p>If you notice this taking place, take a step back and analyze the situation. Figure out what the main stressor is and work with your partner to relieve the stress so that these negative conversations can become less frequent. The use of invisible support, like cooking your partner’s favorite meal before they come home from a stressful day at work, can help alleviate the stress without directly trying to find a solution to their problems. It is common to fall out of sync with your partner every once and awhile, but do not allow it to hurt your relationship.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">There Is A Decline in the Amount of Sex:</span></h2>\n<p>When you are stressed, your mind is preoccupied with dealing with the situation that caused the stress. In dealing with it, it takes time away from your day that you could have spent with your significant other. You are burnt out and exhausted, so it is not unreasonable to assume that you would want some time to yourself. It is also reasonable to assume that having sex with your partner is the last thing on your mind. However, this needs to be communicated to your partner because they cannot read your mind. Make sure your partner knows why you are not in the mood to have sex with them. Tell them that you have had an exhausting day/week and need some time to recharge &#8211; mentally and physically. Reassure them that the decline in intimacy on your part is not a reflection of your lack of love or attraction to them. If they know what is going on, they can understand the situation and provide help in ways that you find beneficial. Even if you are not in the mood for sex, maybe having a movie night cuddled up on the couch can keep the romance alive and allow for some decompressing on your part.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Taking the Stress Out on Each Other:</span></h2>\n<p>Bad days are inevitable. However, taking your anger out on your partner is not the solution. This can cause you to take out your personal stress to your partner, causing both of you to be in a bad mood. This bad mood can lead to nagging and picking fights over the smallest things. It can also cause you to be over-critical of your partner, leading to their withdrawal. Nobody wants to have everything they do scrutinized and judged, when in the grand scheme of things, they are not doing anything wrong. When you are stressed, our brains fixate on negative thoughts and events. You need to actively fight against transferring your anger and frustration onto your partner. Remember that they are your biggest fan and want to see you happy. Allowing your negative behavior that’s caused by your stress to come between you and your partner is unacceptable. Have a conversation about the situation and work together to remove the tension from your relationship.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Marital Satisfaction is Going Down:</span></h2>\n<p>No one likes to constantly be around stress and conflict. Life is too short to be sweating over the small stuff and stuck in a situation where you are constantly miserable. When stress is continuously introduced into your relationship, it can become mentally draining and negatively affect how satisfied and committed you feel within your partner. If you and your partner are living together, you will experience more stressors due to your financial and living situation being dependent on one another. When faced with stress, it can have a negative impact on your relationship satisfaction. Research shows that wives are less satisfied in their relationship when met with stress compared to their husbands. This gives wives the perception that their relationship is falling apart and that they have problems in multiple areas. It also shows that the more stress you have, the more you blame your partner, and the greater the decline of your relationship satisfaction. This is where good communication comes into play. Although it might be a difficult conversation to have, it is necessary to talk to your partner about your current feelings with your relationships. Once it is addressed, mitigating steps need to be taken to repair the relationship satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Everyone is human at the end of the day and is bound to be affected by stressors. It is how you treat our partners and the amount of communication occurring while stressed that plays a big role in relationship satisfaction. If your partner verbally lashes out at you when they are having a bad day, try to take a step back and realize that their anger is misplaced. Communicate your feelings about that negative behavior with your partner so that it doesn&#8217;t occur in the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Natalia Walcott</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s be frank, long distance relationships suck. No one wants to be away from their spouse or significant other. Being away from them for prolonged periods of time is even harder. You will very seldom find someone who says “Yeah, me and my partner are in a long distance relationship, and it is the best thing that has ever happened to us. I love being hundreds of miles away from them and Facetiming on the phone.” We naturally want to be around those that we care about. Personally coping with that separation can be difficult. In addition to that, you have to help your significant other cope with the distance as well. Many say distance makes the heart grow fonder, but you can&#8217;t just rely on that. Actively taking a role in maintaining your relationship is necessary to its survival. Try some of these suggestions to help preserve your long distance relationship.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. Stay Positive</strong></h2>\n<p>Take control of your attitude about the distance. You cannot change the circumstances. However, bringing positivity into an already difficult situation can help you and your partner cope with the situation. Tell your partner how much you love and appreciate them. Surrounding your relationship with this positive energy will help your relationship satisfaction increase.</p>\n<p>Think of why you two got together in the first place and decided to continue the relationship, despite the distance. Before you and your partner began the long distance relationship, a conversation must have occurred. It probably consisted of where both of you saw the relationship going and what the future held. This already shows the seriousness of your relationship and the fact that both of you saw something worth holding on to. Research shows that long distance couples are more committed to their partners than geographically close partners. Take this as a positive sign that the odds are in your favor.</p>\n<p>Find comfort in the little things. Remember that this distance will not last forever. You have someone who loves you and wants to be with you despite the obstacles. On top of that, you have the ability to focus on yourself and become a better version of you that your partner has not experienced yet.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Practice Necessary Communication</strong></h2>\n<p>Talk to your partner about the amount and type of communication you expect. Having those conversations can help prevent problems in the future. Communicating everyday does not mean your relationship is any better than one where you communicate three days out of the week. Every relationship is different and presents unique needs and expectations.</p>\n<p>Do not believe that you have to compensate for the lack of physical interaction by constantly texting your partner. This can get mentally draining and might annoy your significant other. Communication should arise organically; you should not feel like you are obligated to communicate with your partner.</p>\n<p>Be sure to congratulate your partner when they relay positive news to you. Acknowledge and capitalize on their achievements, since you aren&#8217;t able to physically be there to celebrate with them. The acknowledgement of those positive events can allow your partner to see that you are just as happy and invested into seeing them succeed as they are. It also gives both of you a positive event in the relationship to celebrate.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. FaceTime Each Other</strong></h2>\n<p>We are very lucky to have the ability to see each other while not being anywhere near each other. Video chats have given us a different way of communication. Since you are unable to physically see your partner, the next best thing is FaceTiming (or Zooming, etc.) them. Research shows that seeing your partner can deepen the sense of connectedness in that moment and throughout the relationship. Looking into each other&#8217;s eyes and seeing your partner’s face as they smile and talk can make you feel closer to them. Recognize that this type of communication will be less frequent than texting and most likely require some planning ahead of time. Alternating between texting, calling, and video chatting can be beneficial to your relationship. Remember that you are not obligated to constantly communicate with your partner.</p>\n<h2><strong>4. Don’t Idealize or Villainize Your Partner</strong></h2>\n<p>When we’re happy in our relationships, we tend to think of our partners as better than they actually are. Despite the separation between you two, the idealization of your partner can be beneficial to keeping the relationship together. However, it also makes reuniting with your partner more difficult and possibly disappointing. Remember that people change, and it is not necessarily a bad thing. Both of you have been apart from each other for some time, and are bound to change. Whether it be in regards to appearance or personality, do not expect the perfect image of your partner to walk through your door.</p>\n<p>Likewise, don’t be too hard on your partner. Since you two are living apart and do not know each other&#8217;s daily lives, it can be easy to make assumptions about what they are doing and who they are hanging out with. Confronting your partner about these assumptions could come off as jealous or possessive and potentially pose a threat to the relationship. You both are a part of each other&#8217;s lives, but at the same time, you have lives outside of the relationship. Your partner cannot devote all of their time to you. They might be busy and can&#8217;t return a call or text. Don’t assume that they have lost interest in the relationship; communicate what you are feeling and go into it with a positive attitude.</p>\n<h2><strong>5. Make Time Out of Your Schedules to Visit Each Other</strong></h2>\n<p>Shared activities are important in maintaining a relationship. It allows for self-expansion and the introduction of novelty into the relationship. Being in a long distance relationship makes it harder for those shared activities to occur.</p>\n<p>It is important to have something to look forward to in the relationship. The long distance between you and your partner should not be or feel permanent. Take time out of your schedules to visit each other. This reunion should be fun and introduce you to a part of your partner’s world that you have been missing out on.</p>\n<p>Don’t spend all of your time hanging out at their place. Make the most out your trip. Go out and become integrated into their social networks. Getting to know your partner’s friends and enjoying their favorite activities with them will get you more acquainted with their life. It also allows you to participate in future conversations with your partner when you are apart This is because you have created new memories together and have familiarity with important people in their life.</p>\n<p>Long distance relationships might be hard, but with the right person, they can also be rewarding. Making the decision to commit to a long distance relationship already shows that you both believe that the love between you two could conquer the distance. Be sure to put time into the relationship and exercise effective communication. Remember, it takes two to maintain a relationship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Caitlin McNulty</strong></p>\n<p>As much as I would like to sugarcoat it, the truth is that breakups are hard. Add a global pandemic and months of quarantine into the mix, and you are in for a real treat. To those of you who are going through a breakup or divorce in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, know that you are not alone. China has seen a significant rise in divorce filings since their quarantine lifted slightly in March, which unfortunately may be paralleled in the United States as the pandemic continues and stay-at-home restrictions prolong. Although divorces and breakups in general are occurring for a multitude of reasons, the pandemic has increased financial troubles, lack of control, too much time with your partner if living together, too little time with your partner if long-distance, and, frankly, too much time to reflect on your relationship and whether or not you are satisfied with your partner – all of which can be detrimental to a healthy or already-suffering relationship.</p>\n<p>As social distancing has become part of our “new normal,” it is especially difficult to experience a breakup in today’s world with the inability to travel, spend quality time with friends and family, and stay occupied in public as a means of speeding up the breakup recovery process. If you are having a difficult time processing how to move on from a relationship while the world is almost at a complete stand-still, try engaging in the suggestions below to help get you back on track and thriving by the time the pandemic is over.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. Restart or Find New Hobbies</strong></h2>\n<p>Although it may have been months or even years since you have been single, remember the time before your relationship &#8211; when <em>you</em> were your top priority. What activities did you enjoy doing? How did you de-stress? It may feel strange to have to relearn what you once enjoyed doing, but this is actually a very common challenge for newly single people. Depending on the length of your relationship, you may have invested in and relied on your partner in your everyday routine for a long time, which makes the recovery process especially difficult. Although it may seem overwhelming at first, slowly reintegrate yourself into activities that tap into your strengths and make you feel your best. Although options are limited while staying at home, there are still a myriad of things to do to make yourself happy. Remember that book you have always wanted to read? Order it online. How about that show you heard everyone talking about but never had time to watch? Play the pilot episode. Do you want to master your apple pie recipe? Head to the grocery store and get baking. Do whatever will make you happy in the long-run.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Feel <em>all</em> the Emotions</strong></h2>\n<p>Although you may wish you could just erase the horrible feelings that are associated with a breakup, it is important to work through what you are feeling in order to move forward. If you are having a bad day filled with self-doubt and worries about the future, embrace that feeling and cry it out instead of attempting to suppress those negative emotions. Psychologists have found that attempts to suppress any negative thoughts and emotions actually cause you to obsess over the exact thought that you are attempting to ignore – a psychological phenomenon called the paradoxical effect of thought suppression. In turn, this pattern prolongs your negative emotional state instead of allowing you to feel the negative emotions when they arise and move on quicker. Especially in quarantine, we have lots of time to ourselves to think about what went wrong in our relationship, what qualities we did not like in our partners that we will aim to avoid moving forward, and what qualities we did not like in ourselves that may have contributed to the breakup. Whatever the case, feel when you are sad, feel when you are happy, feel when you are grateful, and feel when you are angry. Do not suppress your feelings because you think that will make you stronger. It actually makes you stronger to tap into your emotions and fully understand how your relationship has impacted you and your emotional well-being. Be mindful that if you have previously been diagnosed with depression or if your negative emotions become too overwhelming for you to handle on your own that it is strongly encouraged seek help from a professional.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. Get Creative with Social Support</strong></h2>\n<p>Although there has been mixed evidence about the role of social support in speeding up the breakup recovery process, it is especially beneficial to reach out to your loved ones, especially if quarantining alone, in this time of extreme uncertainty and increased loneliness. The myriad of social networking apps and websites can help you get out of your antisocial slump while social gatherings are essentially non-existent due to nationwide capacity limits, closed bars and restaurants, cancelled events, and stay-at-home restrictions. Schedule a Zoom happy hour with your high school or college friends, host a Netflix party and watch your favorite movie with your loved ones, have a socially distanced hangout in your backyard, or even keep it simple with a quick text, phone call, or FaceTime to a friend. Although it is preferable to see someone face-to-face, it is simply not realistic during COVID-19, and you will be shocked at how good it feels to just talk to someone virtually and gain some sort of social interaction during quarantine.</p>\n<h2><strong>4. Soak Up Some Vitamin D</strong></h2>\n<p>Vitamin D from the sun has been proven to buffer humans from a variety of mental health conditions, but most notably from depression. While many Westerners have deficient levels of Vitamin D regularly, the rate is likely rising due to being cooped up inside while following COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Increased negative emotions due to the breakup and decreased exposure to Vitamin D is a bad combination that could lead you to develop depression or other mood disorders. Therefore, to minimize your chances of sinking into a psychological slump, head outside every day to obtain Vitamin D and recharge your battery. The sun is always a good choice (with SPF, of course!), and getting outside is one of the only safe activities we can participate in these days. If you live near the coast, hop in your car and take a day trip to the beach. If you live near the mountains, research open trails and go for a hike. Even without exquisite landscapes, taking daily walks around your neighborhood will allow you to leave your house, soak up the sun, and clear your mind. You can even lie by the pool if that is an option for you at home. The possibilities are endless with outdoor activities, so soak up some Vitamin D to help you get back on your feet and decrease your chances of accumulating a negative mental health outcome due to the negative combination of the breakup and quarantine.</p>\n<h2><strong>5. Step into the World of Online Dating</strong></h2>\n<p>Although you may not want to take this step for weeks or months post-breakup, the world of online dating is extremely beneficial in the age of COVID-19. Since we are limited in exposure to potential partners in the “traditional” setting of bars, gyms, and the like, take advantage of the plethora of online dating platforms. There are so many focus areas in online dating apps and sites (including by interests, geographical location, and other background factors) if you are looking for someone who matches some specific aspect of your personality. Or, you can go rogue and use the more mainstream, lackadaisical, trending apps. Although there are skeptics of online dating as a successful way to truly connect with a partner, recent research has shown that couples who met online were less likely to divorce or separate and were more likely to report higher marital satisfaction compared to couples who met “traditionally,” or offline. This finding should make you hopeful that although you cannot go out and meet anyone in the public sphere, you may actually have more luck finding a long-term partner online. Keep in mind that everyone recovers from a breakup at their own pace and has a different timeline of when they feel ready to get back out there, so take your time, feel what you need to feel, and know that online dating is just a click away when you feel ready to take that step.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Sophie Schwartz</strong></p>\n<p>Navigating relationships is hard. There will always be new obstacles to overcome, new conflicts to resolve, or new feelings to understand. We all remember the excitement and intensity that comes with being in a new relationship, and we strive to keep those feelings alive for as long as possible. But what happens when the honeymoon phase ends? It is well established that relationship satisfaction – how happy you are in your relationship – tends to decline over the course of relationships. This fact can be really disheartening, especially for individuals who are trying desperately to maintain happiness, closeness, and intimacy with their partners but don’t know why the spark has gone out and don’t know how to get it back. Research has shown that there are many behaviors and activities that couples can use to help maintain intimacy and happiness in their relationships. Relationship Maintenance Behaviors (RMBs) are these activities. They are intended to enhance the relationship and/or keep the relationship moving forward. Below are five relationship maintenance behaviors that any couple can use to help strengthen their relationship, reignite the spark that has been lost, and maintain happiness and intimacy long-term.</p>\n<h2><strong>#1: Spend Quality Time Together</strong></h2>\n<p>It goes without saying that spending time together promotes closeness. In romantic relationships both shared relationship activities and joint leisure activities, have been shown to improve relationship functioning and happiness in all stages and types of relationships – dating, cohabiting, long-distance, marriage, and so on. Any activity that partners can do <em>together</em> constitutes relationship activities: going to see a movie, taking art or cooking classes, going for a hike, or taking a trip.</p>\n<p>Evidence from various studies tells us that exciting and novel activities – rather than pleasant, relaxing, or routine activities – are more likely to improve relationship quality and facilitate closeness between partners. Importantly, the best and most fulfilling activities, in terms of relationship satisfaction and overall happiness, are those which <em>both</em> partners enjoy and are motivated to participate in. Any activity can be beneficial to any couple, but only if both partners are excited to do it. The <em>quality</em> of the time you spend together – more than the amount of time and the type of activity – will be what determines whether the shared activity is beneficial for your relationship or not.</p>\n<h2><strong>#2: Maintain Relationship Rituals</strong></h2>\n<p>Relationship rituals are exchanges between partners that are planned, occur regularly, and have symbolic meaning. There is a distinct difference between a ritual and a routine in that routines are things that simply need to be done like folding the laundry or grocery shopping. Grocery shopping <em>can</em> be a ritual, but only if the couple places significant meaning on that activity.</p>\n<p>Research shows that having and maintaining relationship rituals can increase levels of commitment in a relationship. Essentially, showing commitment to the ritual indicates to your partner that you are committed to them. Couples who continually engage in their chosen ritual(s) tend to show higher levels of relationship satisfaction and experience more positive emotions all around. One common relationship ritual is weekly or regular date nights, but any kind of activity can serve the purpose of a ritual as long as both you and your partner believe the act to be meaningful and symbolically powerful in the context of your relationship together.</p>\n<h2><strong>#3: Mitigate Potential Threats</strong></h2>\n<p>Sometimes individuals find themselves being attracted to people other than their partner. Alternative others, potential others, and potential alternatives all refer to the individuals that could potentially pose a threat to your relationship – people that represent alternatives to your current relationship. In a world full of potential alternatives, how do you maintain commitment and lower the risk of infidelity?</p>\n<p>One option is to derogate, or downplay the attractiveness of, potential alternatives. This cognitive technique has been shown to help individuals who are highly motivated to stay committed to their partners. The downside is that one cannot be forced to ignore potential alternatives. Forcing your partner to ignore potential others may elicit the opposite of the intended effect and push your partner further towards the forbidden fruit.</p>\n<p>Another option is to avoid suggestive or risky situations or people. A few simple examples of this could be getting separate rooms when traveling with a co-worker, not eating lunch with the same acquaintance every day, or limiting your interaction with potential others online. The point of avoidance is to set boundaries, recognize when your relationship with a potential alternative is posing a threat to your current relationship, and remove yourself from situations that may invoke intimate feelings with alternative others. It will benefit you and your relationship to save your emotional energy and cognitive resources for your partner or for friends who are clearly not potential romantic partners.</p>\n<h2><strong>#4: Forgive</strong></h2>\n<p>Allowing yourself to forgive someone who has hurt you is not an easy task. Whether it be lesser offenses or full-blown cheating, forgiveness takes a lot of patience, time, and understanding. Forgiveness can be characterized by a desire to forgo condemnation or revenge even when these feelings seem justified. Despite the difficulties of forgiving a partner who has broken your trust or hurt you in some other way, forgiveness has been shown to facilitate many positive relationship outcomes such as increased commitment, decreased likelihood of break-ups, increased constructive communication, and increased relationship satisfaction. Some even suggest that forgiveness is foundational to the healing process.</p>\n<p>Forgiveness allows for healing in the victim of the offense <em>and</em> encourages self-reflection and accountability in the offender. In many cases, forgiveness can be a beacon of hope for couples teetering on the edge of collapse after trust has been broken or pain has been caused; however, there are circumstances that do not warrant forgiveness. When the offense is repeated or particularly extreme, forgiving the offender may only make things worse. The trick is to know what your personal limits are – when is forgiveness appropriate, and when have your partner’s actions surpassed what you can tolerate?</p>\n<h2><strong>#5: Assess and Re-Assess the Relationship</strong></h2>\n<p>“So… what are we?” Many people have experienced first-hand what it is like to ask or be asked this question by a significant other. Typically, we think of these ‘state of the relationship’ conversations as occurring at the start of a new relationship to define “what we are to each other.” Conversations like these provide couples with clarification on individual expectations going into a new relationship, and that is great. Once the state of the relationship is declared, however, many couples fail to revisit these conversations until the time comes to either take the next step or take a step back.</p>\n<p>The ‘state of the relationship’ conversation, is not only a mechanism to define the relationship at the beginning but also to express partners’ wants, needs, commitment levels, and goals <em>throughout</em> the relationship. While these conversations may seem awkward, taboo, scary, or conflict provoking, relationship talk has been widely proven to increase relationship satisfaction and protect against break-ups. Regularly talking about and building your relationship together acts a protective factor against possible infidelity, and can facilitate intimacy through the disclosure of sensitive topics. By regularly re-evaluating and keeping up with each other’s wants, needs, commitment levels, and desires, couples can promote intimacy and strengthen the relationship as a whole.</p>\n<h2><strong>Be Flexible</strong></h2>\n<p>Like everything else in life relationships <em>will change</em>, and couples may have to change along with them; but change doesn’t have to be negative. Refusing to acknowledge that your relationship needs some attention will only make things worse. Recognize that change is inevitable <em>and</em> that you have the power to navigate the waters of change with positivity and resilience.</p>\n<p>Spending quality time together, maintaining relationship rituals, mitigating potential threats, forgiving, and regularly re-assessing your relationship are five things that any couple can do to help strengthen and reinforce their relationship, but this list is far from exhaustive. There are tons of other ways to strengthen and protect relationships: practicing gratitude, having a supportive social network, or even having sex! Spend the time looking for the relationship maintenance behaviors that work best for your relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Caitlin McNulty</strong></p>\n<p>Television and movies play a significant role in our daily lives, which should come as no surprise considering the average American household watches 7 hours and 50 minutes of television per day. Moreover, popular date night activities include going to the movies or staying in to binge-watch the latest hit television show. However, have you ever stopped to think about whether the movies and television shows you watch impact how you act and what you expect from your relationship? Research shows that constant exposure to media’s depictions of romantic relationships may form or reinforce your own behaviors and interactions. This alternate reality can be either beneficial or detrimental to your relationship, depending on what you watch, how long you watch it, and how realistic you believe it to be.</p>\n<h2><strong>Romantic Programming</strong></h2>\n<p>Romantic movies and television series can have different effects on your relationship depending on how you perceive what you are viewing. On one hand, romantic programming can be a good influence on your relationship through its reinforcement of optimistic relationship outcomes. Research shows that television comedies, television dramas, and romantic movies all positively affect one’s relationship through the consistent themes of love conquering all and having soulmates. Can you think of one romantic comedy where the main characters don’t end up together? Even in La La Land, when they don’t actually end up together, the writers still included an alternative ending so they could show what happens if they did end up together! By consistently portraying happy endings even after conflict, movies and television shows reinforce the idea that no matter what happens between a couple, true love overcomes everything. With thousands of easy-to-follow plots reinforcing this exact ideal, we are programmed to believe that this is true and can happen in our own relationships as well.</p>\n<p>However, romantic programming can also be a bad influence on your relationship if there is a divide between what television and movies portray as normal relationship behaviors and what you are actually experiencing. Research shows that more time spent watching relationship programming is associated with lower relationship satisfaction. Romantic programming – whether it be a rom-com, drama, or soap opera – tends to foster unrealistic standards and expectations of partners by their portrayal of the “ideal” partner. When one partner messes up in a romantic movie or television show, he or she tends to know exactly what to do to make it all better – whether it be a grand gesture or the perfect apology. Let’s face it: no significant other in real life knows exactly what to say and do to make it up to the other partner after every conflict. Resolution between partners in a real relationship requires communication, not mindreading like soap operas and dramas often depict.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Reality Dating Shows</strong></h2>\n<p>Dating shows have become one of the most popular subcategories of reality television over the past few decades. While the Bachelor was basically one-of-a-kind in the early 2000s, there are now dozens of different reality dating shows available for streaming today, with seven new variations premiering in 2020 alone. One theme that is constantly reinforced on reality dating shows is the idea that dating is a game. This idea normalizes the fact that multiple people should be competing for your love, instead of focusing your attention on cultivating one relationship with a potential partner. This perspective may make men and women more hesitant to settle down and form serious bonds with one another.</p>\n<p>Reality dating shows also constantly reinforce gender stereotypes: that men are sex-driven and women are sex objects. One study found that these roles were reinforced once every 4 minutes for an hour in a sample of different reality dating shows. This constant reinforcement of sexual gender roles can lead to unrealistic expectations about sex within a relationship and blur the boundaries that women have when it comes to sex, which could increase conflict in a relationship.</p>\n<p>How realistic one perceives reality dating shows significantly affects how one perceives their own relationships. If you watch the Bachelor purely for comedic relief or to scout out your next vacation destination, then these stereotypes may not carry over into your relationship. However, if you view it as a guide to finding true love and planning the perfect date, these stereotypes may carry significant weight in how you act in your relationship.</p>\n<h2><strong>Violent Media</strong></h2>\n<p>Excessive exposure to violent programming can negatively affect your relationship. Violence is portrayed in television and movies as either physical aggression, such as punching and hitting, or emotional aggression, such as manipulation and yelling. Researchers have found that repeated exposure to physical aggression on television is associated with men’s increased physical aggression in romantic relationships. Films and television shows that depict physical violence between romantic partners tend to portray the male as the perpetrator and the female as the victim, which increases the tendency of men to mirror physical violence in their own relationships. On the other hand, repeated exposure to verbal or emotional aggression on television is associated with increased verbal or emotional aggression for both males and females. Verbal aggression is instigated by both sexes in the media, which reinforces its normalcy in relationships among both partners. While it is important for different media sources to shed light on the dangers of physical violence, a detrimental side effect is that it may also normalize aggression and constant conflict among couples.</p>\n<h2><strong>Take Home Message</strong></h2>\n<p>What you consume daily gets ingrained into your brain and either consciously or subconsciously manifests itself in your behaviors. Although television and movies can have positive impacts on your relationship, they can also carry some negative impacts as well. To protect your relationship from the negative effects of TV and movies, make sure to realize that most movies and television shows – even reality shows – are scripted and therefore not real life. By drawing the line between fictional relationships and real relationships, you can still enjoy your favorite movies while maintaining realistic expectations towards your partner and your relationship as a whole.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Corinne Issa</strong></p>\n<p>They call it the seven-year-itch for a reason: the fact is, falling in love is really not that hard. Staying in love? That’s another matter altogether. Those early butterflies can make you feel as if you’re the luckiest person on the planet. But as time passes, we get to know our partners’ habits and reactions. They become…predictable. And predictable sometimes means boring. Of course, that doesn’t mean that every love affair is doomed, but the spark does fade from many relationships. We’ve all seen it: people drift apart. One challenge can be that the quirks you find so endearing when the relationship is new can become irritating or even maddening over time. That predictability factor might be the culprit: when love is new, everything becomes more vivid and exciting. Then, that vibrancy seems to fade. Enter the antidote: the answer to the damage done by the erosion of time. If you want to feel the freshness of new love for a longer period of time—possibly even forever—make date night part of the spice that keeps things exciting.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Date Night Maintains the Relationship Spark</strong></span></h2>\n<p>I know&#8211; you’re suspicious. You&#8217;ve heard about restoring romance or intimacy by getting off the daily treadmill of your life and recapturing the ambiance of earlier days. But who has the time? Our jobs put us on different schedules, and wouldn’t it take more energy to link up our schedules? Besides, isn’t it normal to have the first flush of love fade a bit? I hear you. But the time to attend to the relationship is not when you feel the fade, but while love is still in bloom. Date night can relieve, not cause, more stress—and it just might bring a lifetime of happiness.</p>\n<p>Studies indicate that shared activities help sustain relationships; however, positive, stress-free activities and relationship quality &#8211; both in the moment and for the future &#8211; require both of you to want the activity and the result it might bring. Studies also indicate the quality of the connection should be a priority before there’s a threat to it. Most individuals who enjoyed their date night activities reported a positive impact on their relationship even after the event; they felt they had learned more about their partner and could implement higher levels of relationship skills.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Date Night Goes the Extra Mile</strong></span></h2>\n<p>Everyday maintenance is valuable, but date night can add that something extra. It presents opportunities to openly discuss thoughts and feelings, maintain a cheerful and affectionate demeanor, and gives the partner assurances associated with commitment and satisfaction; it also predicts whether the relationship will last over an 8-week period. Research shows that date nights have positive effects including a dedication to commitment, concern for the partner, more time to understand the significant other, shared fun time, and greater communication. If both members of a couple are willing to demonstrate these qualities, they are definitely long-term-relationship material.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Date Ideas</strong></span></h2>\n<p>So, what kind of activities work best in keeping a relationship healthy and thriving? Studies show that activities that are novel, exciting, and arousing will boost closeness more than those that are routine. According to one source, activities that are “adventurous, passionate, sexual, playful, romantic, spontaneous…and involving a high level of alertness and involvement” are those that best reinforce closeness and commitment. One study showed that partners who shared skydiving reported higher levels of relationship satisfaction than those who did not. I suppose if you’re willing to jump out of a plane for your partner, you’re invested in the relationship! Yet, closeness was reportedly highest when activities involved a balance of safety and risk: no one wants to explain to the ER doc that they were engaging in risky behavior to keep their relationship healthy. The getaway—a holiday or day at the beach—is at the top of the chart in fostering closeness and intimacy. Dining out, or even planning alone time where the couple cook together, shopping, gardening, or setting aside designated time for intimacy are all activities that work well. Knowing your partner’s preferences for any of these activities might provide the extra spark that keeps the flames burning. As with any activity and any successful relationship, communication and honesty are essential; accommodating the partner was a crucial aspect of both parties&#8217; positive relationship evaluation. Finally, pick activities that do not produce anxiety; studies show stress-free events generated more closeness and were associated with higher relationship quality. To keep it stress-free, show you’re invested! Don’t take on an activity you don’t like, simply because you want to make date night work. That shared mutually-attractive activity is out there: go find it.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The Value of Quality Time</strong></span></h2>\n<p>Yet, more important than the activity itself is the commitment from both parties to invest in spending time together. Studies show that positive activity outcomes depend less on what the couples do and more on how they feel about doing them together. Activities chosen for their ability to boost closeness work better than activities that are selected for the “fun-factor.” Also, when one half of the couple perceives the partner is only half-heartedly committed to the activity, lower closeness is reported. According to one study, couples who didn’t make it to the three-month mark of the study involved men who were not eager to participate in shared activities with their partners.</p>\n<p>Couples who build date nights into their relationships experience better communication, greater affection and gratitude for the other, and a desire to spend more time together. Date night provides a welcome entertainment so couples can return to focusing on important issues without distractions. The date night experience indicates that the partners are taking the relationship seriously and willing to invest in it. Both contribute to alleviating stress for the other during enjoyable events. One of the additional major perks? Date night leads to more shared time, which in turn, creates higher levels of sexual satisfaction.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Take Home Message</strong></span></h2>\n<p>If you have a good thing going and want your relationship to last, don’t wait for signs of trouble.

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>By Lilly Johnsen</strong></p>\n<p>If you’ve discovered your partner cheated on you, you may be asking yourself what to do now. Infidelity is one of the most difficult and distressing issues that couples might face. After the discovery of an affair, you most likely will experience feelings such as jealousy, shame, rage, depression, fear, and loneliness. The biggest question after a couple faces infidelity is what they will do next. Will they break up or try to work through it? Couples with higher levels of commitment and satisfaction often try to work through the situation because they have invested a lot of time and effort into the relationship. Although very difficult, committed partnerships can survive the trauma of infidelity and even experience personal growth from the situation. If you find yourself in this situation, there are ways to try to repair the relationship and get past the feelings of anger and resentment. When deciding to work through the aftermath of an affair, forgiveness is the key part of healing.</p>\n<h2><strong>Decision-Based Forgiveness and Emotional-Based Forgiveness</strong></h2>\n<p>Forgiveness is crucial to helping partners with the emotional whirlwind that comes with cheating, and it can be the pathway to mending the relationship and rebuilding trust. There are two types of forgiveness you have to undergo in order to move forward with the relationship: decision-based forgiveness and emotional-based forgiveness. Decision-based forgiveness is the cognitive decision to let go of judgement and hostility. Decision-based forgiveness focuses on the actual commitment to forgive, and you can make this choice while still experiencing hurt. Decisional forgiveness comes first and can lead to emotional forgiveness. It is making the commitment to forgive, which is the beginning of an inner process of healing. Emotional forgiveness, on the other hand, is about reducing negative emotions, such as anger, resentment, and bitterness towards your partner. Emotional forgiveness is critical to gaining peace and moving on with the relationship. Forgiveness can be very difficult for someone who was cheated on, but if you want to rebuild the relationship, you must start here.</p>\n<h2><strong>Steps to Forgiveness</strong></h2>\n<p>The three main parts of forgiveness are dealing with the impact, searching for meaning, and recovery or moving forward. It may be hard for you to know where to start. These steps help outline a conversation that you and your partner should have to work towards decisional and eventually emotional forgiveness.</p>\n<h3><strong>Dealing with the Impact</strong></h3>\n<h4><em>Step 1 &#8211; Deciding if you want to forgive.</em></h4>\n<p>Deciding that you want to forgive is the first step in working through the situation. This does not mean you forgive what has happened, only that you are willing to move forwards and work towards actual forgiveness. It is possible, and very likely, that you still have emotional pain but want to continue the relationship. The first step is acknowledging you want to forgive your partner and move through the next steps.</p>\n<h4><em>Step 2 &#8211; Cheater should speak about their offense.</em></h4>\n<p>The partner involved in the affair should explain what happened, without leaving out other secrets that may be uncovered later. If all the information is out on the table, it allows you both to rebuild the relationship on honest and direct communication. Encourage them to be open during this time. Even though it might hurt, it will be best in the long run.</p>\n<h4><em>Step 3 &#8211; Offender explains their actions.</em></h4>\n<p>If your partner cheated on you, they must explain what led them to it, such as other relationship problems. Your partner should not use these explanations as an excuse, but to help you understand why it happened – and reduce the chance that it will happen again.</p>\n<h3><strong>Searching for Meaning</strong></h3>\n<h4><em>Step 4 &#8211; Give your emotional reactions.</em></h4>\n<p>After being cheated on, you will feel emotions such as anger, betrayal, and hurt. Processing emotions that were created by infidelity is critical to the process of recovering from it. The first step in processing emotions is to work through them on your own, which will allow you to explore how you truly feel and help in the recovery process. You may want to try writing down what you want to say to your partner. This will help you organize your thoughts and emotions and have a more productive conversation. In order to process these emotions, you must share them with your partner as well. Try not to be too emotionally reactive during this point in the conversation. Individuals who are less emotionally reactive and more able to communicate their feelings clearly are more likely to move forward with the forgiveness process.</p>\n<h4><em>Step 5 – Empathizing with your pain.</em></h4>\n<p>Ideally, your partner should provide empathy for the hurt they have caused you. When two people are struggling to work through something, it can be difficult for them to see the other’s point of view. Therefore, it is important to give your emotional reactions, so they can get a better understanding of the pain you’re going through. If your partner shows remorse and empathy for you and your feelings, you will be more likely to forgive them. Empathy can be an indirect pathway to both decisional and emotional forgiveness. Although you can’t control how your partner reacts, you can ask them to respond to your feelings and apologize for their behavior.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Recovery or Moving Forward</strong></h3>\n<h4><em>Step 6 &#8211; Develop a plan to stop or prevent future behavior.</em></h4>\n<p>An organized plan can help reduce your anxieties. Your partner should completely cut off from the third partner. This can help give you a sense of peace and security. It would be unwise (and unhealthy) to continue contact with that person, even if it is a friend. You may also want permission to check up on your partner when they are not around after they have cheated, due to the lack of trust. However, be cautious about frequently checking up. Constantly worrying about where your partner is may become obsessive and overbearing. If you want to check up on your partner, you should establish a plan with them. For example, plan where and when you call each other before bed or, if you live together, on business trips.</p>\n<h4><em>Step 7 &#8211; Let your partner forgive themselves.</em></h4>\n<p>Self-forgiveness is an important step in the whole forgiveness process for the involved party. When someone cheats on their loved one, they often face deep regrets and shame for their behaviors. They can deal with the negative emotions and views they have about themselves by accepting responsibility for their actions, expressing remorse, reducing self-shame, and recommitting to their values. This will lead to a renewal of self-respect, self-compassion, and self-acceptance. Let your partner go through the process of forgiving themselves.</p>\n<h4><em>Step 8 &#8211; A formal request for forgiveness.</em></h4>\n<p>After going through all of these steps, your partner should make a formal request for forgiveness. Human touch can be powerful during this time because it promotes connectedness. Take the hand of your partner or hug them when having this conversation. During this time, you and your partner should discuss how you want to move forward. If you decide to forgive, you must not use the offense as a weapon in future fights.</p>\n<p>It is not easy getting over infidelity, but the place to start is forgiveness. If you begin with the decision to forgive and let go of hostility, you can eventually reach a place of emotional forgiveness. Forgiveness is a powerful thing. A decision to forgive can help you deal with the feelings of stress, revenge, and hatred your partner has caused you. Being able to move on from the infidelity can lead to emotional relief and clarity – as well as higher relationship and life satisfaction. Forgiveness creates an increased understanding of each other. It promotes a feeling of a greater sense of closeness, intimacy, and freedom to be oneself. Couples who have achieved forgiveness show more investment in their marriages, greater closeness, a more equal balance of power, and higher levels of marital adjustment compared with couples who haven’t reached forgiveness. However, forgiveness is just the beginning of the long recovery process from infidelity. It will help you build your relationship from the ground up, but you both must continue to work on increased intimacy, communication, trust, and relationship satisfaction. Relationships can be very difficult at times, but if you decide to work together through infidelity and other issues, your relationship can be restored and even strengthened.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>by Mackenzie Arnold</strong></p>\n<p>From getting the kids ready for school, school drop offs, working 9-5, soccer practices and dance recitals, helping the kids with homework, making dinner, and getting the kids ready for bed, it’s no wonder that couples often complain that they do not have enough quality time together. Well, luckily for us, COVID-19 brought us PLENTY of time to spend together &#8211; or are we really so lucky? Is it too much time? If you’re now finding yourself complaining of having too much quality time with your partner, don’t worry &#8211; you are not alone. COVID-19 is a difficult time for couples to navigate through and we are here to provide you with some tips on how to help your relationship thrive during this stressful, scary time.</p>\n<h2><strong>Create Separate Space</strong></h2>\n<p>It is okay to not be together all the time. According to Robert Levenson, a psychology professor of the Berkeley Graduate School, it is important to give yourselves some alone time to be able to “recharge” yourselves and your relationship. It is common for couples to fight more when they are cooped up together under stress. Dr. Arthur Aron, a research professor in psychology, says it can be helpful to separate yourselves during the day while you are working, doing household chores, etc. It’s a good idea to try to find separate spaces to do your work during the day, so you aren’t cramping each other’s style.</p>\n<p>Chris Kraft, a psychologist, says that incorporating some self-care can also be great for recharging yourself and helping de-stress. Do a face mask, watch your favorite tv show, read a book, or any activity that you enjoy. Incorporating some sort of exercise into daily life is also of upmost significance right now when normal exercise like walking around your office, going to the grocery store, climbing flights of stairs in your work building, etc. have been diminished to much less frequency. Whether it be a high intensity workout, a stroll around your neighborhood, yoga, meditation, or whatever your preference may be, including exercise is always a good idea.</p>\n<h2><strong>Be Understanding</strong></h2>\n<p>During this time, it is important to understand that emotions are high, and everyone reacts to stress in different ways. If your partner is having a hard time coping with the very difficult times we are in, be understanding, ask what you can do to help, help out with some of the chores you don’t normally do. Allow your partner to lean on you more now than ever if they need it! Additionally, try not to expect too much from your partner right now. We have lost a lot and they may be grieving normal life, which may make it harder for them to be on their best relationship behavior right now. So, cut them some slack and give them some time to cope.</p>\n<h2><strong>Communicate Effectively</strong></h2>\n<p>The phrase “communication is key” is so commonly known because it is so true! This is true especially during quarantine where emotions are elevated and stressors are abundant, it is necessary to be open and honest in communication with your partner. Bundling up your emotions and holding them inside in a time like this can be detrimental to your relationship. If your partner is doing something to make you upset or there is more that they can be doing to help your relationship/family, tell them! Being upfront and honest with your partner can help avoid a heated outburst from occurring and escalating both of your stress levels even more.</p>\n<p>A helpful tip for all relationships, not just romantic relationships during quarantine, is to use “I statements” instead of “You statements.” It is beneficial to start a statement by saying “I feel” instead of saying “you…” because “You statements” may make someone feel like they are being personally attacked. For example, instead of saying “You never want to have romantic date nights with me,” you could say something along the lines of “I would love it if we could plan some more sweet date nights together; it would mean a lot to me.”</p>\n<h2><strong>Plan Safe, Fun Date Nights</strong></h2>\n<p>Although the times of extravagant, fun date nights may be on hold right now, it is still important to have time set aside for amusing, quality time together (while still being safe). Barbara Rickey, MS, LPCC, suggests that you find a new show/movie to watch on a streaming service, cook a nice dinner together, have a sunset picnic in your car, play a new game, etc. Be creative and even surprise each other, says Madeline Howard, a writer for <em>Women’s Health Magazine</em>. Surprising one another with a cute, exciting activity to do together is one of the best ways to make your partner feel loved and special during these times.</p>\n<h2><strong>Keep Sex in Your Schedules</strong></h2>\n<p>Sex is known to be beneficial for your health for several reasons like improved memory, better-quality sleep, reducing stress hormone levels, burning calories, and more. Indeed, we know that sexual activity even boosts immunity – which is good news in the days of COVID-19! Regular sexual activity increase antibodies that help immune systems fight off infections better. Besides the health benefits, sexual activity is also beneficial to keeping a close, intimate relationship with your partner. Agreement, understanding, and cooperation between partners is shown to be much better and healthier after sexual activity has taken place than before. Likewise, when couples are satisfied sexually in their relationship, they are more likely to report feeling satisfied and happy with their relationship and life as a whole.</p>\n<h2><strong>Stick to Your Routines</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the best ways to keep yourselves in check mentally and physically during quarantine, is to set routines for yourself. According to Gigi Engle, sexologist and author of <em>All the F*cking Mistakes: A Guide to Sex, Love, and Life</em>, sticking to a routine can help eliminate the panic and fear that may be rising inside you. Help yourself (and your partner) by setting a time to wake up, to get your work done, to do self-care, to do household chores, to spend time together, and to go to bed. Having a normal routine will help life feel more “normal” in a time where life can see aimless and dull. This will help you both feel less stressed, increasing the quality of your relationship and time spent together.</p>\n<h2><strong>Additional Advice</strong></h2>\n<p>If you and your partner are having a difficult time coping together right now, it is okay to seek help! Many psychologists and therapists are offering virtual counseling sessions and are willing to help more patients. Therapy is a great and effective way to help support relationships with ourselves and with others. It is important to recognize when you need help and it is never too late to seek help of any kind either. In addition to in-person services, there are several online resources available to you. <a href=\"http://OurRelationship.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OurRelationship.com</a> – recently recognized as the “Best Overall” relationship counseling platform by <a href=\"http://OnlineTherapy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OnlineTherapy.com</a> – offers free or low-cost brief services to couples and has been shown to be effective in several studies.

Socially interacting with others has drastically changed before our eyes. Many people are working from home, bars and clubs are closed, and hanging out with friends is not as frequent or care-free as it used to be. With establishments being closed and many people staying home, we have had to change our routines and adjust to this new lifestyle. Assuming you are living with your significant other, one of those adjustments is being around each other more often. Depending on your relationship, this can either be a good or a bad thing. Nonetheless, it is important to take this new abundance of time with your partner to explore your relationship and keep it thriving during this tough time. Here are some tips to keep the romance alive during the pandemic:</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Take Each Other on Dates:</strong></span></h2>\n<p>Since popular date night spots, like the movies and bowling alleys, are not open or particularly safe to go to right now, it is easy to choose to stay home rather than go out with your partner. However, do not fall into this trap. This should be your opportunity to use your imagination and come up with out of the box ideas for dates. They do not have to be fancy or expensive. They just need to be enjoyable outings both of you will appreciate. Make time for dates at least once a week. Take turns coming up with dates to impress your partner. It is important to get out of the house and, if applicable, away from your kids. Giving undivided attention to your partner and making new memories is beneficial to increasing the strength of your relationship. Your partner knowing that you put thought and effort into the date is a recipe for success.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Don&#8217;t Smother Each Other:</strong></span></h2>\n<p>It is easy to be all over each other when you are both at home. Adjusting to working at home with your partner can be difficult as well. Avoid invading each other’s personal space all of the time. You both need to establish a daily routine &#8211; relatively similar to the one you had before the pandemic occurred. Try starting a new project, working out, doing yoga, or FaceTime your friends. Do something that you love and communicate with others, so that you can stay productive throughout your day and not put pressure on your partner to fulfill your whole sense of self and purpose. Everyone needs different environments and social groups to fulfill needs that their partners can’t or are unable to meet. Capitalize on this newfound time of being at home and carve out some personal time for yourself.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Support Your Partner, Especially When They Are Struggling:</strong></span></h2>\n<p>This pandemic has made life hard for many people. Many have come down with the coronavirus themselves or know someone who has experienced debilitating symptoms. Businesses have had to close down, employees have been laid off, unemployment benefits have been hard to obtain, and people are unable to go outside, see their friends/loved ones, and live a normal life. Mental health concerns have risen due to the sudden isolations everyone has had to endure. Make sure you are supporting your partner during this time, especially if they have been directly affected by the pandemic. Try giving your partner “invisible support” by removing stressors from their life that they may not be consciously aware of. If they are having a bad day, make sure you do something that will cheer them up. If they just got laid off and are worried about money, do not go frivolously spending on unnecessary items. Give them the reassurance that things will get better and that you will support them every step of the way. However, do not lose sight of yourself trying to fulfill your partner’s needs. Celebrate the moments of success they see along the way, and be sure to stay positive and remain genuine with your support.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Communication:</strong></span></h2>\n<p>Strong communication is the foundation for every good relationship. It is necessary to communicate with your partner about grievances you may have, problems you need to solve, or just random events that occurred throughout your day. It is also important to express interest about your partner’s day and wellbeing. Your and your partner’s lives have been suddenly changed by the pandemic, so it is more important than ever to communicate how it has affected you and your relationship. You can’t expect your partner to read your mind. They might not be aware of the effect of their actions. Remember that you are not the only one in the relationship whose needs and wants are important. Create an environment that is open for sharing. Make sure you are receptive to any criticism that may come your way. Do not come in with a negative attitude. Once negativity, blame, and insults are introduced into the conversation, it is no longer proper communication. Respectfully express your needs to your partner in an effective manner. Make sure you are being direct about what you need so that your partner can properly comprehend the problem and make any necessary adjustments. Be sure to praise them when they make the effort to change the things that upset you.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Remember Why You Chose Your Partner:</strong></span></h2>\n<p>Take a trip down memory lane. Recall the first time you two met. Think about your wedding night and bring out the wedding album. Get nostalgic about your honeymoon. Think of the reasons why you love your partner and why you decided they were the one you wanted to spend the rest of your life with. If you are not married, think about all of the major events that brought you two together. It is in this moment that you should see the good that this relationship has to offer and has been offering you.</p>\n<p>Try to implement these tips while you are cooped up at home with your spouse. This is a great time to evaluate your relationship and make any necessary changes while you are both constantly around each other. Research shows that an increase in intimacy, satisfaction, passion, and investment has a positive impact on a partner’s perception of their relationship, viewing it as longer-lasting and more serious. We all want a successful relationship. Let&#8217;s make sure we are putting in the time and effort to achieve it!</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Infidelity—or cheating—is a very common concern among people in monogamous or exclusive relationships. After all, it has been estimated that up to 36% of American adults have been cheated on by a partner in the past. Before we discuss why people cheat in their relationships, it’s important to define what constitutes cheating in the first place.</p>\n<p>The truth is, what makes a person unfaithful to their partner means something different for each of us. For some, activities such as watching pornography alone or masturbating alone could be viewed as unfaithful behavior. For others, cheating could refer to dressing to attract the sexual attention of others, receiving close emotional support by someone else of their desired gender, or kissing someone on the cheek. Many might not view these behaviors or actions as unfaithful, instead seeing actions such as sexting, flirting, browsing dating profiles, or masturbating over a webcam with another person as cheating. Despite these differences of opinion, the vast majority of Americans agree that engaging in any sexual activity (kissing, sexual touch, giving or receiving oral sex, vaginal or anal intercourse) would be viewed as definitely cheating.</p>\n<p>Because most couples just assume that they’re in an exclusive relationship without talking about it with their partners, we probably don’t even have a sense of how our partner even defines infidelity. That’s bound to result in some conflict! The solution? Have a chat about it with your partner: where’s the line for them? Where’s the line for you?</p>\n<h2>Whose relationship is at risk?</h2>\n<p>The short and uncomfortable answer is, anyone could cheat or be cheated on. The long answer is, researchers have determined that there are some traits that are more commonly associated with cheating. First, couples who are less committed to one another are more likely to experience infidelity; which means that married couples are least at-risk compared to couples are who merely dating or dating and living together. However, commitment aside, there are also important behaviors to look out for. The primary behavior is communication: couples who are unable to have difficult conversations needed to maintain, repair, or end their relationship—or couples who use invalidating and negative communication styles are most likely to cheat. Second, partners who do not feel validated or appreciated by their partners are more likely to seek validation elsewhere. The other most important factor is situational: those who encounter or put themselves in more risky “slippery slope” situations (spending extensive time away from partner, having close relationships with possible partners such as friends or coworkers, drinking or taking drugs to lower inhibitions) are at greater risk for cheating.</p>\n<p>If we put together the individual risks (e.g., feeling neglected or rejected by partner; wanting reassurance) and the risks at the relationship level (e.g., poor and reduced communication, deteriorating sex life, avoidance of conflict), they will combine to make infidelity far more likely if either partner encounters or creates opportunities to be sexually or emotionally close with others.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "Top 3 Reasons To Have More Sex"
    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Sex is seemingly all around us, everywhere we look: it’s on our television sets, all over the internet, in movies, in books and magazines, on the news, in politics. Hearing and reading about it tends to grab our attention; it’s exciting, it’s titillating. But when it comes to having sex in our own relationships, we may be less inclined to engage. There are a number of known barriers that prevent us from having the sex-lives we want—whether it’s a function of there not being enough hours in the day, or difficulty communicating each other’s sexual needs and desires in the relationship. But even without those barriers in place, we all have different drives and motivations for sex.</p>\n<p>According to a notable group of psychology researchers in the US, there are upwards of 200 different reasons why Americans choose to have sex in their relationships at any given time: to seek pleasure, reduce stress, to feel attractive, to feel closer to one’s partner, to express appreciation, to prevent a negative outcome—the list goes on. Of course, there are also couples who use it for procreation and family planning. Generally speaking, though, we are living in an age where many of us take great preventive measures to avoid pregnancy. So why is sex so important in our relationships?</p>\n<h2>It Can Strengthen The bond In Your Relationship</h2>\n<p>Have you ever felt like engaging in sexual activity with your partner made you feel closer or more intimately connected? It may surprise you to know that the reasons why are scientific. Each time a couple has sex, there are electrical signals fired in the brain that motivate each partner to stay with that person and care for them. Even when we are just sexually aroused or excited, we are more likely to seek compromise and cooperation with our partner and make sacrifices for them. As humans, we are wired to find a life-partner and commit to making the relationship work.</p>\n<p>We even know that couples tend to report greater relationship satisfaction after sex. However, there’s a catch. If the motivation for sexual activity is positive (for example, for pleasure, for greater intimacy), you are far more likely to feel more satisfied in your relationship after doing the act. On the other hand, though, if the motivation for sexual activity is to avoid conflict or consequence (for example, to keep a partner interested or stop a fight from escalating), you are more likely to be less satisfied and less committed in the relationship. Actually, so can your partner: Being aware that our partner is just doing it to avoid conflict is—after all—not very sexy. So, while sex can bring us closer to our partner, it only works if you’re doing it for the right reasons.</p>\n<h2>It Can Protect Your Relationship From Insecurity</h2>\n<p>Sometimes we feel insecure in our relationships—maybe we’re feeling bad about ourselves, or something at work isn’t going well. Or maybe we’re starting to question whether our partner is truly committed to us. Insecurity can lead us to be more attention-seeking, defensive, or aggressive with our partners—which can lead to real conflict in the relationship. Some people who experience significant anxiety in their close relationships may have what we call an “anxious attachment style.” Attachment styles are developed early in life based on our upbringing and our relationships with the individuals that raised us. Does this sound like it matches you or your partner?</p>\n<p>As it turns out, couples who have more satisfying sex tend to report less insecurity in their relationships. Feeling highly intimate with our partners not only makes us feel more satisfied with our partner, it can also make us feel less anxious about the relationship in general.</p>\n<h2>It’s Good For Your Health</h2>\n<p>So far, we’ve talked about the benefits for your relationship and intimate connection. But there is a neat little benefit to regular, satisfying sexual activity: it’s actually good for your physical health!</p>\n<p>Frequent and satisfying sexual activity can increase the number of antibodies in your body—and since antibodies help prevent infection, that means your immune system functions better. Other health benefits include (but are not limited to) reduced risk of heart disease, improved cognition and memory, lower cholesterol, improvements in sleep, and fewer reports of muscle and joint pain. We’ve even learned that per minute, men tend to burn 4.2 calories while women tend to burn 3.1 calories—that’s a third of what we burn during a 30-minute session on the treadmill!</p>\n<p>From these 3 reasons alone, engaging in sexual activity with your partner has some serious benefits. Remember, though, you will only benefit from these effects if the sex is satisfying and initiated for the right reasons; anything that is physically and/or emotionally unpleasant is not going to provide these benefits. Make sure to get to know your needs and practice talking to your partner openly and honestly about them.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>It’s almost impossible think about romantic relationships without thinking of sex. Sex is indeed a fundamental part of intimate relationships: it’s fun and often satisfying, it emotionally connects us to our partner, it can help bolster relationship commitment, and it even has some serious health benefits (decades of research indicates that it can reduce stress, burn calories, improve cardiovascular health, and extend our overall life expectancy!). That seems like enough to convince you that sex is unquestionably a major positive for your relationship, right?</p>\n<p>Well, would you believe that married couples these days seem to be having it less and less? I don’t mean that as your relationship progresses, you and your partner do it less often. I mean that all married couples in the United States—across gender, race, geographic region, and education level—are having less sex per year than married couples did in the 90’s, 2000’s, and 2010’s. So much for all the progress we made for sexual freedom and expression, 2020!</p>\n<p>So, if sex is so great, why aren’t married people having more of it?</p>\n<h2>Finding the Time in your Busy Day</h2>\n<p>It may not come as a surprise to know that one of the primary reasons people in relationships report having sex less frequently than they’d like is because of time. When we finally fall into bed at night, sometimes we’re too exhausted to muster up the energy for anything other than sleeping. Here are a just a few reasons why…</p>\n<p>When we look at statistics, it turns out we are actually spending more time at work and more time parenting our children than in generations past. If you think about it, it makes sense. It is more normal than ever before in history for women to have a job or career outside the home, so it is increasingly rare for one member of the household to be a homemaker (which, by the way, is a job all in its own!). As job markets get more competitive and businesses look to save money, the demands at work increase exponentially. If you put that together, not only are you and your partner likely to have less time at home, you’ll like have more chores to take care of when you finally do get home.</p>\n<p>With parenting, we can also understand the recent increase in demand. The hours your grandparents spent raising your parents was likely limited to cooking and cleaning. School was less competitive; there was no “screen time” to manage and patrol; playtime was spent freely outdoors. Thanks to the rise of technology and the increased emphasis on wellbeing and safety, we spend hours each day making sure our kids finish their homework, eat enough nutritious foods, have fun and organized playdates, and are engaged in and safety transported to and from their afterschool activities. This is, of course, on top of the shopping, cooking, and cleaning. I’m tired just thinking about it all…</p>\n<p>Where are we getting these extra hours in the day? Well, of course. We’re taking it out of our relationships. We have less alone time, less time to have meaningful and intimate conversation, and less time to physically connect.</p>\n<p>It is easy to let sex slide from your routine. While there is no easy solution, having a better understanding of and empathy for where your time is being spent can be a good first step. It is okay to be too tired. Allow that to relieve some of the pressure to get it on. A second step is to talk about it with your partner. Come up with a signal or keyword when you each find a brief period of alone time. Don’t expect to find hours of your week that can be devoted to sex. Got hours? Great! Got minutes? Sometimes a “quickie” here and there is enough to spark some serious excitement and bring some fun and spontaneity back to the relationship.</p>\n<h2>The Division of Household Chores in your Relationship</h2>\n<p>In opposite-sex relationships, household chores tend to fall disproportionately on women. Once upon a time, this was actually beneficial for couples’ physical intimacy. In the 1980’s and even 1990’s, couples who divided household chores based on traditional gender roles (women: shopping, cooking, cleaning; men: paying bills, driving, lawn maintenance) actually reported having more frequent sex.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, times have changed. In the 2000’s, 2010’s, and now in 2020, we have seemed to more or less blurred the lines between “male” and “female” chores. We may feel more equal to our opposite-sex partners and, as a result, we feel that the division of labor in the relationship is more fairly split. And wouldn’t you know—when we experience more equality in our relationships, we feel more connected to our partners, more sexually attracted to our partners, and are more sexually active.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the division of household chores in your relationship. It could explain why you’ve been feeling your sex life slow down.</p>\n<h2>Pornography Use in your Relationship</h2>\n<p>Pornography—any type of media featuring nudity or behavior that is intended to cause sexual arousal—has always been a part of human history. But the internet has made it easily accessible, immediately available, free, and even mainstream. There is a lot of ongoing research about the effects of porn use on relationship wellbeing. In short, it has its benefits and its consequences.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the consequences. With frequent pornography use, our expectations for what “normal sex” looks like are prone to shift. It is all too easy to forget that the people you see on your screen represent unrealistic beauty standards, are heavily-edited and choreographed, and are performing for the camera. If we don’t keep those important facts in mind, watching pornography can make intimacy with your partner feel lackluster. Through research, we know that straight men who watch porn more frequently tend to report lower relationship satisfaction with their female partners compared to men who watch porn less frequently. And across genders, frequent individual porn use can make us feel less committed to our partners as we visualize ourselves with other people in fantasy. Don’t panic—the old adage still applies here: everything in moderation will not harm you.</p>\n<p>Now, what are the benefits? A lot of the negatives of porn use are focused on individual consumption—that is, porn that is viewed alone without one’s partner. We happen to know that couples who use porn together in their relationships report more satisfaction with their sex lives than partners who use porn on their own. We tend to see that couples who are open to using pornography together in their relationships are more likely to communicate openly about their sexual desires, wishes, needs, and interests. Better sexual communication = more satisfying sex, and more satisfying sex = increased desire.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that pornography is not for everyone. If you or your partner are uncomfortable about using porn, that does not mean your sexual enjoyment is doomed. Viewing porn together will only help if it is something you are both interested in experiencing together.</p>\n<h2>Communicating our Needs</h2>\n<p>The final obstacle is in communicating our sexual needs. Some couples have no problem openly sharing their needs and desires in bed; other couples may find it absolutely terrifying to talk about. “What will my partner think?” “Will they judge me?” We have been taught in American society that talking about sex and intimacy is embarrassing and maybe even wrong. Maybe some don’t even feel like we deserve to have our needs met.</p>\n<p>It is inevitable that you and your partner—no matter how sexually compatible—will have moments where only one of you is aroused or interested in engaging. Or maybe the type of sexual activity your partner is interested in is just not doing it for you right now. That’s perfectly normal. We all have different needs and desires at different times.</p>\n<p>When this happens—when one partner wants to engage in sexual activity and the other does not—we have the freedom of choice. We can choose to engage despite our lack of initial interest—maybe to avoid hurting our partner’s feelings or maybe in the hopes that engaging will awaken our own desire. Or we can choose to honor our own needs and reject our partner’s sexual advance. It can be difficult to find the right way to “reject” an advance with our partner. If you’re concerned about hurting your partner’s feelings or inciting conflict in the relationship, try “positive rejection strategies” such as telling your partner that you love them and are attracted to them, but are just not in the mood. By reassuring our partners in the moment, we can both honor our own needs and avoid hurting our partners’ feelings. There’s even been research to show that positive sexual rejections in relationships can lead to improved sexual satisfaction!</p>\n<p>If you are experiencing coercion in your relationship—that is, if you feel you are being or have been manipulated verbally or physically into sexual activity with your partner—it may be especially difficult to navigate communication around sex. Your desires and needs are important and you deserve to feel sexually safe in your relationship.

      "rendered": "<h2>The Once-a-Day Relationship Challenge</h2>\n<p>Have you ever heard of the once-a-day challenge? It’s a challenge where couples commit to having sex every day for a week, a month, 100 days, or even a year unless one partner is sick, traveling, or uses the escape clause to particularly decline. Some benefits couples find from this is committing to daily sex allows for couples to explore sexual desires they normally wouldn’t because instead of figuring out whether or not to have sex, they have to figure out how to. Many who take on this challenge enjoy feeling healthy and relaxed, the endorphins sex rowels up are great and can leave people feeling younger. Sexual desire and sexual interaction distinguish intimate relationships from other interpersonal relationships but what comes first? Does a healthy, satisfying sex life improve and strengthen a relationship or does a healthy, satisfying relationship improve sexual satisfaction?</p>\n<h2>Sexual Satisfaction and Relationship Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>The internet gives us many things, including descriptions of explicit sexuality and people blogging, bragging, and complaining about their sex lives. A big part of our identities includes the type of sex we pursue and how we pursue it. However, even in a cultural landscape saturated with sex, research in 59 countries found most people have sex within the context of an intimate relationship. Many people believe you can’t have a satisfying intimate relationship without a satisfying sex life. Adults of all ages in the United States rate faithfulness and a happy sex life as the most important aspect of a successful relationship, especially in marriage. They even rate it far more important in the relationship than sharing household chores, money, housing, religious beliefs, shared interests and hobbies, children, and agreement on politics. Relationship satisfaction is the product of an overall evaluation of a relationship and sexual satisfaction is each partner’s evaluation of the sex life a relationship has. The responses to questions about both seem to overlap. People who report being more satisfied with the sexual aspect of their relationship report being more satisfied with their relationship as a whole. This is true for young and old, same-sex and different-sex, relationships and marriages all over the world with personal beliefs that prioritize the sexual part of relationships. For example, people who think oral sex is important care more about giving or getting oral sex compared to people who don’t value it as much.</p>\n<p>There are many factors that play a role. Attachment styles are a factor. People with an anxious attachment style are more affected by the quality of sexual interactions they have with their partners on a given day than people with a secure attachment style. People with an avoidant attachment style are less affected. Gender is another factor. Men have a stronger association between sexual and relationship satisfaction than women do even though sex is consistently significant for both. Longitudinal research has studied how relationship and sexual satisfaction change over time. In the early years of a relationship, sexual satisfaction predicts changes in relationship satisfaction. For example, newlywed’s satisfaction with their relationship and sexual satisfaction affect each other in both directions. Relationships where partners are just getting to know each other are more affected by sexual satisfaction while they are discovering what they each like and dislike. Couples who are able to connect sexually early on develop a deeper bond, on average, than couples who aren’t able to as easily. As for established relationships, couples married 10 years and 30 years on average have a reliable association between their initial levels of sexual satisfaction and changes in their relationship satisfaction. For men and women, no matter the stage a relationship is in, a couple’s sex life predicts the course of the committed relationship. On the other hand, the older a couple gets, the less their relationship satisfaction will change their sexual behaviors. Often times, after a couple has been together for more than a decade their sex life becomes predictable and although sexual satisfaction still predicts changes in relationship satisfaction, relationship satisfaction will no longer predict changes in sexual satisfaction or behaviors.</p>\n<h2>Relationships Without Sex</h2>\n<p>Can a relationship be satisfying without sex? Yes! There are millions of people that wait until marriage to have sex. Some for religious reasons, some for personal reasons that don’t involve religion or spirituality at all. People can have satisfying romantic relationships without sex or sexual attraction whether they identify as being asexual or not. For most people, some sort of sexual interaction is essential to fulfilling intimacy, but it is possible to voluntarily abstain from having sex and be satisfied with a relationship. People who are involuntarily celibate for a long time against their will are rarely satisfied with their relationships but may stay in them for other reasons. A walk in the park, cooking together, or any other shared behavior cannot substitute sex. Sex is often something only shared between intimate partners in a relationship. It often defines what being intimate with someone else means, especially in popular culture, but it is not the only way to attain intimacy with someone. There are various ways to be intimate with someone outside of physical intimacy. Chances are, the better the emotional intimacy in a relationship is, the better the sex in the relationship will be.</p>\n<p>One effect of an increased number of people valuing satisfying sex is that virginity is no longer as attractive as it used to be in mainstream society. It makes sense, when the purpose of sex was primarily reproduction, people sought out partners with little or no sexual experience. Now, people assume that experienced partners will be better lovers and the remaining a virgin until marriage is less common. That being said, too much sexual experience can also be a turn-off. On average, college students around 21 years old want their prospective partners to have a handful of previous partners, to be experienced enough to know their desires and preferences, but not have more than a handful of partners.</p>\n<h2>The Course of Sexual Desire in Relationships</h2>\n<p>Long-term relationships present couples with what can feel like a trade-off. Sexual desire tends to be aroused by new experiences and risk but commitment to a relationship tends to be reinforced by feelings of familiarity and security. The trade-off is that the safer and more reliable a relationship becomes, the less sexy it becomes. This especially echoes with women seeking help for their low sexual desire. Women often report that the security of knowing how much their partners love them and feeling comfortable taking their clothes off fades the excitement that once accompanied their sex lives and they lose sexual desire. On average, sexual desire does not decrease for women and men and yet as couples get older, they tend to have less sex. The major cause for this is what happens as we age, especially to men. Changes in the relationship are another major reason. If relationship satisfaction declines over time, sexual satisfaction, and the frequency of sexual interactions will decline. Even so, surveys conducted in the United States and Germany controlling for the effects of age and relationship satisfaction confirm that sexual frequency and satisfaction tend to peak in the first year of a relationship and decline in the second year. Fortunately, these studies found the decline to level off after the second year. What continued to change was the feeling of lust for a partner depending on the emotional climate of the relationship on a particular day. This doesn’t mean that couples have to choose between passion and security in their relationship. On average, declines in sexual desire aren’t inevitable nor universal. Even age-related declines in sexual desire are significantly smaller for people in better relationships. Relationships take work but it is possible to maintain a healthy and satisfying sex life within a stable and secure long-term relationship regardless of age.</p>\n<h2>Ingredients of a Healthy Sex Life in Relationships</h2>\n<p>For centuries, people have made all kinds of pills, ointments, and tools to guarantee sexual satisfaction. Spoiler alert, it’s not that simple! One of the most common complaints from couples, especially heterosexual males, is that they don’t have enough sex. In western and sexually liberated countries like the United States and non-western countries like Iran and China, simply having more sex can lead to more satisfaction and fewer complaints. Among newlyweds, the more couples report having sex, the more sexually satisfied they are over the next 4 years. Furthermore, partners are more satisfied the more time they spend having sex, and the longer their average sexual encounter lasts independently of how much sex they have. The association between sexual frequency and general happiness doesn’t follow a straight line. Sure, rarely having sex is linked to being less happy compared to having sex regularly, but how often do people who have sex regularly actually have sex? People who have sex on a weekly basis are happier than people who don’t, but people who have sex more than once a week aren’t much happier than people who have sex once a week. Quantity isn’t everything.</p>\n<h2>Quantity of Sex in Relationships</h2>\n<p>Just because the quantity of sex is linked to greater satisfaction doesn’t mean that having more sex will make a sexual relationship more satisfying. If you’re having amazing sex, you’re likely to want to have sex more often. Having sex more often might be a result of sexual satisfaction, not the cause. An experiment with a sample of 128 heterosexual married couples who reported having sex between once a month was conducted to measure positive moods and study the relationships. The couples were split into two groups. The first group was directed to double the amount of sex they usually had, and the other group didn’t receive any instructions. The couples completed an online questionnaire for the next 90 days. Having more sex did not lead the first group, assigned to double the amount of sex they had, to experience more positive emotions. In fact, compared to the couples who weren’t instructed to change their sexual behaviors, the couples who were instructed to increase the amount of sex they had were less happy by the end of the study. Even though the first group was having more sex, they were enjoying it less and possibly experiencing less sexual desire as a result. Sexual satisfaction heavily depends on why you’re having sex. If you’re having sex to express desire and passion, it’s a turn on. If you’re having sex like it’s a chore, it’s a turn-off. Couples struggling to conceive a child know the pressure to have a certain amount of sex at a certain time of the month to maximize fertility often takes the fun and excitement out of having sex. Couples who participate in the once-a-day challenge often reflect learning this same lesson.</p>\n<h2>Sexual Technique in Relationships</h2>\n<p>Have you ever heard of Kama Sutra? It’s one of the oldest and most popular examples of manuals and guides offered to advise people on how to best please their partners and improve their sex life. Unbeknownst to many, only one out of the thirty-six chapters in Kama Sutra is actually dedicated to sexual practices and the illustrations of various sex positions commonly featured in magazines and phone applications. Guides like Kama Sutra don’t tell couples to have more sex, they promise to improve the quality of sex couples are having. Kama Sutra does this by identifying specific techniques to make sex more satisfying, which a skilled lover would know, and an unskilled lover could learn. Kama Sutra hasn’t really been scientifically studied, but there are sexual behaviors that are reliably associated with greater sexual satisfaction. For example, the more people consistently reach orgasm, the more sexually satisfied they are. For men, sexual satisfaction is higher the more consistently their partner reaches orgasm. For women, it isn’t, presumably because there’s little variability in men experiencing orgasm. Women and men who report greater sexual satisfaction and more regular orgasms are more likely to report engaging in mutual masturbation, oral sex, and penile-vaginal intercourse. However, there aren’t specific techniques that are universally found to be crucial for a satisfying sex life. The greater the variety, the more satisfied women and men are. Another factor associated with sexual satisfaction in relationships is what couples do right before and right after they have sex. Take a moment to think. How often do you and your partner set the mood by dimming the lights, playing music, or engaging in some sexy talk? How often do you and your partner cuddle and express affection after you have sex? Even after accounting for how long sex lasts or how often couples have sex, women and men are more sexually satisfied the more they spend time bonding and enjoying time together after sex. Our behaviors don’t just affect how our partner physically feels and possibly sexually please them. Our behaviors affect how we make our partner feel emotionally. The key to sexual satisfaction is not necessarily sexual skills, but enthusiasm for a sexual connection and an interest in pleasing our partner.</p>\n<h2>Responsiveness in Relationships</h2>\n<p>Aside from technically competent genital stimulation, women report the highest levels of sexual satisfaction when they are in a committed relationship. Sexperts rarely emphasize specific sexual techniques and shine a spotlight on the importance of being mindfully present, feeling connected, mutual respect, and good communication. Understandings the quality of a relationships’ sex life requires understanding how partners relate to each other daily. Relationships where couples are happy with communication are relationships where couples stay more sexually satisfied over time. Regardless of how much they have sex, couples are more satisfied with their sex lives the more they report positive behaviors, and the less they report negative ones. For example, expressing approval, complimenting, and not dominating conversations or arguing all the time will improve sexual satisfaction even if nothing else in a relationship’s sex life changes. Great communication is super sexy! We’re most likely to feel understood, validated, and cared for by our partners when they’re responsive. When our partners’ actions to our disclosures and vulnerability meet and exceed our desires and goals, we’re happier. Independent from the general level of relationship satisfaction, the more responsive partners are to each other, the stronger their sexual desire will be for each other. Responsive partners make each other feel wanted, desired, special, and unique. Responsive partners are perceived to be more attractive to their partners and to people outside of the relationship. Regardless of spiritual, religious, political, cultural, racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and other differences, responsiveness is a universal turn-on. We want our partners to understand, validate, and care for us when we are afraid or disappointed, and we also want them to be responsive when we express sexual desire and arousal. The more partners invest time in understanding each other and their sexual preferences, the more they’ll enjoy their sex lives. Instead of spending your time looking for the perfect lover, invest your time in creating and nourishing the perfect love.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In a relationship, when you share a vulnerable expression with your partner you may feel anxious on how they respond. Opening up your heart and your life to your partner for the very first time can be nerve wracking. You might have had a negative previous experience with a past partner leading you to have a more difficult time opening up. But you must remember how important intimacy is to your relationship. Intimacy can be created through communication by disclosing vulnerabilities. Once your partner opens up to you about something, that is sharing a moment with you in being vulnerable. Being vulnerable with your partner is fundamental to building intimacy. Communication is a wonderful way to deepen your intimate connection while building trust on the way. Communicating about vulnerable past events or disclosing something that has been weighing you down can build the skills necessary to address sensitive events in the future. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Responding to disclosure in a relationship:</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fear from not knowing how your partner will respond may stop some people from sharing things that make them feel vulnerable. But disclosing and seeing how your partner responds can help you determine if there is a long-term future with this person. If they respond dismissively and do not listen to you then that might mirror a future response pattern leading to poor relationship compatible. However, if they respond with love, comfort, and understanding your intimate connection will deepen. Now you know you can turn to this person to help manage times of crisis and they will express genuine concern. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Intimate Process Model:</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The intimate process model can better help you understand how intimacy help the development of relationships. Intimacy generally is cultivated when there are interactions when one partner is disclosing thoughts and feelings that may make them vulnerable. Common examples of disclosures are parental divorce, loss of a loved one, or another traumatic event. Disclosures can also be present hardships such as having a poor work evaluation. The intimacy process model works when the partner responses in a way that communicates that they are listening and deepening their knowledge of your true self. Your true self or also known as the inner self is encompassed by your needs, beliefs, and emotions. In your relationship, your partner discovers your inner, vulnerable self by when you disclose and reveal feelings and thoughts that make you vulnerable. Your partner knowing your inner self is important to build intimacy, especially for later stages in the relationship when you may encounter new challenges. The second part of the model is that your partner makes you feel validated and respects you in response to your vulnerable disclosure. The third part is that your partner responds in a way that makes it apparent that they care about you and your wellbeing. These three processes past through an interpretative filter which shapes both of your perceptions on the communication leading to the overall feelings of being understood, validated, and cared for. The interpretative filter plays the role of how your partner will respond to your disclosure. We look to our partners to be responsive during vulnerable times. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Responsive behaviors include four steps:</b></span></h2>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Listen to your partners initial disclosure</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Understand both the meaning of the words on a fundamental level and on a deeper level</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Responding to the disclosures in an understanding way, while asking questions to gain even deeper intimacy</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Being mindful of whether, when and how to transition to another topic to make sure you are not being dismissive</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Responsiveness and Empathy in Relationships:</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Empathy is the umbrella under which responsiveness falls. Empathy means having the capacity for understanding and sharing in another person’s feelings and thoughts. The interpretative filter guides the degree of sensitivity to your partner’s disclosure. Even if your partner may think they are being responsive and empathetic to your intimate disclosure, you have an interpretative filter too which may determine a different meaning and impact of their attempt at intimacy. Our attempt of responding with empathetic behaviors will not be felt unless our partner experiences them that way. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If any step in the intimacy process model fails, such as lack of responsiveness or faulty interpretative filter then the whole model crashes. To make sure you communicate with intimacy, it is important to make your responsiveness resonate with your partner’s mode of communication. So they understand the genuine sincerity of your words. Picking up on times when your partners’ interpretative filter did not register the intent of your reaction and analyzing what was miscommunicated by having an open and honest dialogue is important to making sure the interpretative filter did not jumble what you truly meant. Most of the time caring, understanding, and words of validation are experienced in the way they were mean to. However, sometimes there is a gap between what you say and what your partner takes from what you said which weakens the relationship. Honest communication through times when interpretative filters may confuse intention is necessary to get back on the right track. You may have had an experience of complimenting your partner, but the wording confused the interpretative filter and they took it as a back handed compliment. Getting to the route meaning behind and stating intentions are good strategies to employ when miscommunication is heighten.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why does one feel the urge to disclose in the first place? </b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Well most people want to share thoughts and feelings that make them vulnerable when their motives, goals, needs, and fears come into play. Showing our true self is a process that takes time just like the intimacy process model. Knowing the time and place to disclose also plays a role in how the disclosure effects the level of intimacy in the relationship. Some partners share traumatic experiences on the first date which may be overwhelming and scare off their potential partner.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Others may tell their partner a story that might not be all accurate. Both of these types of disclosures, too quick and inaccurate, do not strengthen intimacy nor build the relationship. There needs to be a foundation to share disclosures so both partners feel safe and ready to accept the other partner letting their guard down. Self-revealing disclosures brings your partner into your zone of privacy. Traditionally we think of self-revealing behavior as verbal, such as disclosing hardships they encountered throughout their life. But self-revealing behavior can also be nonverbal behavior, for example physical touch or sexual contact. Dropping down your defenses and opening up to your partner about private, personal information creates intimacy through communication.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Importance of the Process of Intimacy:</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Thinking back in your relationship when are the times you feel most close to your partner? Some of the instances may be when they supported you after disclosing self-revealing information, such as revealing a concerning diagnosis. Research also supports the importance of promoting intimacy through communication. The intimacy process model that I explained above has been widely researched by experts. It has been shown that closeness and well-being is increased by being in a relationship with an empathetic, responsive partner that expresses feelings of vulnerability.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Evidence also supports that a relationship is damaged when one partner is in a vulnerable state and their partner responds with walking away and becoming disengaged. Imagine how you would feel if you tell your partner one of your insecurities and they don’t respond or give a dismissive answer. It is important to be empathetic and put yourself in the position of your partner, especially when they are expressing feelings of vulnerability. When your response lack empathy, you not only miss the chance to be supportive of your partner; but also, you lose out on an opportunity to enhance the intimacy in the relationship. Also, you may miss out on future possibilities of increasing intimacy through communication, because your partner fears to be vulnerable with you again. If withdrawal in the face of vulnerability keeps occurring throughout the relationship, intimacy in the relationship will really take a hit, even possibly ending the relationship. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Other research studies including one that looked at relationships where one partner had been diagnosed with breast cancer linked increased self-disclosure to predict better partner responsiveness leading to stronger feelings of closeness. Would you believe that having a responsive partner also corresponds to how well patients recover from critical medical diagnose? Empathy and responsiveness really do mean so much to individual and relational well-being and intimacy. In the study, patient’s severe physical pain corresponded to their partner’s gestures of affection and empathy even when all participants had the same general happiness in the relationship.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Role Of Self-Esteem In Intimate Relationships:</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do people with lower self-esteem benefit from disclosing sensitive information? In general, when in a relationship with someone with low self-esteem you have to communicate more clearly in order to properly share your understanding and support, so it gets properly processed through their pessimistic interpretative filter. Interestingly, disclosing vulnerable information does not always have a positive effect. If you struggle with self-esteem research shows that after you disclose you may feel less valued by your partner, while if you chose not to reveal you may feel more valued by your partner. Whereas the opposite is true for people that report high self-esteem, in that they feel more valued by their partner if they reveal and less valued if they do not tell their partner self-revealing information. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Keeping Intimacy in your Relationship:</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Relationships dynamics change throughout time and you may be wondering how to address new challenges in your relationship.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Four Steps to Helping you Enhance Closeness and Intimacy:</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Note</span><span class=\"s2\"><b>: </b></span><span class=\"s1\">Don’t forget about the intimacy process model as it also is important in carrying out these steps.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">1. Participate in Shared Activities</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\">Over time the intimacy and closeness in many relationships declines. This is partly because partners normally get comfortable with the same routine and habits so their relationship lacks new, exciting experiences. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p11\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Self-expansion Model</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> The Self-expansion model explains the common “years of blandness’ following an initial happy relationship. There are two assumptions in the model. The first is no matter the relationship status, people strive to reach their goals by increasing their productivity. To increase their effectiveness they search for resources, learn, and take time in strengthening their skills. The second assumption is that intimate relationships are one common way to enhance your identity and increase capacity to meet your goals. In the first years of a relationship, everything seems new and exciting. You are expanding yourselves together. Your meeting your partner’s family and maybe tasting new cooking recipes. Overtime, you become used to your partner and the exhilaration in the relationship typically fades. Expanding with your partner decreases because expansion has limits. For example, once you stay up all night getting to know your partner’s life philosophy you grow together. But, once you already know your partner, growing together does not come as naturally when you fall into a normal routine. Then the feelings of love and intimacy may fade since self-expansion in the relationship drops.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you bring back growing together into relationships?</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> </b>Create new experiences that unknown qualities and aspects of each partner can come to light. Sharing in activities gives the opportunity to gain deeper levels of understanding, care, and validation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\">Questions to ask when picking a Shared Activity</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you consider it exciting?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Does your partner consider the activity exciting?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Does the time and length of the activity work for both of you?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Can you both grow or move onto new stages of this activity together?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Does this activity have me spending time with my partner or is it more independent?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">2. Support each other</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you know the greater social ties and connections you have the more likely you will live a longer and healthier life? Being there for your partner through thick and thin not only helps with emotional wellbeing, but also physical.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>But what does social support look like in relationships?</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Social support can be as simple as being a listening ear when your partner had a tough day at work. Or it can be more serious types of social support. For example, Christopher Reeve the star of the <i>Superman</i> movies, became paralyzed due to falling from a horse. His wife, Dana, was there by his side the whole way and was constantly committed to him. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Benefits of support in relationships</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Partners in more supportive relationships are better able to face challenges and cope with external stress. Overtime, the benefits of a supportive relationship are still felt, because the partners know how to work as a team to resolve conflicts. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">The role of perception in supportive relationships</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How your partner interprets your support has a major effect on outcomes. That’s why there is a difference in how your interpretative filter perceives support available to you and support you actually receive. People prefer and benefit more from support that relationship experts call <b>invisible support</b> which is support we perceive to be available. The opposite is <b>visible support</b> which is the support you know you have received which can be damaging to one’s self-esteem and actually increase pressure. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This may have you a little confused, so imagine if you have a goal to lose weight and your partner is constantly in your face to monitor your workout and count your calories you may be a little annoyed. That is an example of visible support. An example of invisible support would be knowing your partner is there for you to comfort and motivate you if you are not making the weight loss progress desired. Knowing the level of support can help you be at the sweet spot to not overwhelm your partner. Supportive relationships depend on if your partner’s perception of your support enables them to feel capable and competent in the face of hardships.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">3. Make the Most out of Positive Personal Experiences</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sharing with your partner that you got an A+ on your final makes you feel accomplished and in return your partner typically feels proud of you. Leading psychology researchers have found that sharing of positive events in a relationship, builds both personal and interpersonal resources. This process of sharing positive events is referred to as Capitalization. Capitalization allows us to relive those events when we tell our partner about them and lets your partner experience the positive impact of them with you. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There is a catch to capitalization. Like all the other steps, the success of them depend on both you and your partner’s interpretative filter. There are four possible responses to sharing with your partner your success of getting an A+ on your final:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s1\">Which response would you like to receive? </span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Active-constructive response: Wow! That is amazing! I would love to see the paper; I am so proud of you!</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Passive-constructive response: Oh, that’s great, how did your other finals go? </span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Active-destructive response: An A+, I am surprised. It is a lot better than you got last time.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Passive-destructive response: Maybe I should take that class, since it seems easy. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now think back to what response you typically give to your partner.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How your partner responds and how you respond when there is a sharing of positive events has such an impact in the intimacy of your relationship. Research shows that relationships that have the active-constructive response have the highest levels of intimacy, while relationships that rely on the other responses have much lower intimacy levels.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">4. Forgive each other</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Forgiving is the most challenging step in some relationships. Betrayal happens in different forms not just cheating. Many relationships are challenged by a partner breaking a promise, lying, or talking behind the other partner’s back. If you choose to continue the relationship after betrayal, forgiveness is the only option for a healthy, intimate relationship. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Will my partner forgive me?</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whether or not one partner forgives the other depends on four main factors:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Seriousness of the offense</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Personality of the victim</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Qualities of the apology</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Depth of the relationship</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do I forgive?</b></span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Forgiveness comes from when you transform your pain into a generous, unselfish attitude towards your partner. Forgiveness is a process that involves changing your personal motivation and expressing your forgiveness through behavior and communication.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"> Silent Forgiveness</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> This type of forgiveness happens when your personal motivation changes in that you are motivated and emotionally ready to forgive.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"> Hollow Forgiveness</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Hollow forgiveness is when you only express to your partner that you have forgiven them, but you still lack the emotional motivation to really forgive them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To truly forgive your partner you must be ready and motivated to forgive them and communicate that you have forgiven your partner. Forgiveness is an unselfish act that maintains the relationship by focusing on compassion and sincere apologies.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<h2>Relationship Questions</h2>\n<p>Although everyone tries to cook up a unique recipe for love, the formation, course, and quality of every intimate relationship is a reflection of the personality and experiences each person brings to the relationship. In addition to being mostly water, we’re all made of characteristics and memories that shape us. Our personality is often what mostly draws our romantic partner to us and combined with their personality is what causes a concoction of love’s special chemistry. Instead of relying on horoscopes from astrology or other forms of pseudoscience to predict a relationships’ success or failure, personality traits can be studied through a scientific lens and serve as a reliable, valid tool to improve the relationship we have with ourselves and a significant other. Prior to pondering what makes our relationships what they are, we should self-reflect about what makes us who we are and how our personalities and histories influence our approach to interpersonal relationships.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Tendencies of Personality Traits</h2>\n<p>Imagine your ideal partner, what about them do you most love? It’s common for people to hope they will be in a romantic relationship with someone who’s above average in crucial areas. Physical appearance, sure, but more importantly someone who genuinely admires and appreciates our personality. Someone who’s trustworthy, expressive, and has a good sense of humor. We want the universe to unite us with our soulmate. When actually choosing a partner for a long-term relationship, people often prefer an average-looking person with an amazing personality over an extremely attractive person with an average personality. The relatively stable, distinctive qualities which characterize an individual over time and across various scenarios and influence how they’ll behave and adapt to the world are known as their personality. Are there personality traits that seem linked to the success of failure of a relationship? The first attempts at exploring the relationship between a personality and intimacy focused on possible problems a personality might cause and temperament.</p>\n<p>Psychologist Lewis Terman became famous by identifying the factors that distinguish a happily married couple from an unhappy couple. He proposed that most married partners that sooner or later feel they’re incompatible feel that way not because of new information or events but because of predispositions to unhappiness. That because of nature or nurture they lacked qualities that make people compatible and that they were incapable of finding happiness in any marriage. That theory did not prioritize interpersonal communication or scratch the surface of its importance and impact on a relationship! Terman was a trait theorist and believed that in order to understand a relationship, people must inspect the personality of each partner. The Big Five traits which are pretty general and encompassing yet address specific aspects of personality include openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and negative affectivity or neuroticism. Openness measures how receptive someone is to new ideas, approaches, and experiences. Conscientiousness measures how disciplined and organized someone is. Extraversion measures someone’s preference for social interaction and lively activity. Agreeableness measures someone’s selfless concern for others, their generosity, and how trusting they are.</p>\n<h2>Personality, Emotion, and Relationships</h2>\n<p>Most people’s Big Five are consistent throughout their lives. Even measures of personality from someone’s childhood can predict their adult relationships. Children who throw numerous temper tantrums before they turn ten are twice as likely to divorce and women with a history of tantrums tend to marry men of lower occupational status. When an adult’s personality assessment is conducted, it also leads to links between personality traits and experiences in relationships. Virtually every study on personality traits and relationships have found that people with high negative affectivity tend to ruminate on negative qualities they have, others have, and in the world in general. They seem to be vulnerable to poor relationships and have low self-esteem. In a 50-year study of marriage, engaged people that were negative were more likely to become unhappy and divorce. Of those couples, husbands tended to be more outgoing and impulsive than unhappy husbands who remained married. Thus, unhappy spouses are more likely to divorce if husbands have personality traits that make them prone to engage in deconstructive behaviors like infidelity, financial irresponsibility, and excessive drinking. Behaviors reflecting negative affectivity cause distress which when combined with personality traits will either result in divorce or passive suffering in a stable but unsatisfactory marriage.</p>\n<p>The other personality traits have not been studied as much but one can easily expect that couples who are more agreeable or more conscientious are usually happier. People with disagreeable partners report being treated with condescension and disrespected. People with neurotic partners report their relationships suffering because of self-centeredness, jealousy, dependence, and a lot of criticism. You can imagine why being in a relationship with someone who constantly highlights your flaws, rarely gives you the benefit of the doubt when you make a mistake and is often hostile. Last but certainly not least, sex lives tend to be less satisfying for couples where one or both partners suffers from high tension and distress associated with negative affectivity. Keep in mind, similarities in a soul’s age, general intelligence, political views, and religious beliefs predict happiness better than similar personality traits. You don’t need to try to date your clone, your best bet is to connect with someone who is generally more agreeable and positive than someone who is just like you in regard to the Big Five. Personality traits set the boundaries within a relationship and affect how partners communicate, perceive each other’s behavior, and respond during difficult times. The traits that have been found to matter the most are negative affectivity, agreeableness, and conscientiousness because they set the day-to-day emotional tone of our relationships.</p>\n<h2>Negative Affectivity and Low Self-esteem Affect Relationships</h2>\n<p>Recent research on the dependence regulation mode demonstrates that people with low-self-esteem underestimate how favorably their partners view them. This underestimation sets off a domino effect of unintentional sabotage. For example, being excessively defensive, overreacting to criticism, dismissing genuine praise, and feeling and expressing strong negative emotions like anger. The cycle starts with personal experience of self-esteem, then someone underestimates positive feelings towards them and the relationship, they then devalue their partner and feel hurt and neglected which leads to expressing their discontent, and then they and their partner are pessimistic and dissatisfied with the relationship which reinforces this deadly cycle. The point is, when someone has chronic low self-esteem, the relationship really suffers. They assume their partners don’t think highly of them and that others share the pessimistic perception they have of themselves. Studies show they are wrong! Insecure people struggle with the difficult decision of whether to express concerns and risk becoming even more vulnerable or to be overly cautious and self-protective in the relationship. In an effort to protect a fragile personal identity, people with low self-esteem try to reduce the risk of rejection but as a result build a wall between themselves and their partners which increases their insecure feelings of the relationship.</p>\n<p>Unjustified doubts sew deadly seeds that can weaken a relationship. They lead to a form of self-sabotage where insecure people perceive their partner is unfavorable and they express discontent when all their heart wishes is to be closer and receive for confirmation, they are special and loved. When someone with a personality trait of low self-esteem believes their partner doesn’t truly love them, they look for evidence they do, yet detect rejection even when it doesn’t exist and devalue their partner. Perhaps they devalue their partner as a defensive strategy to believe they’ll have less to lose if the relationship ends. Contrastingly, confident people with high self-esteem are less sensitive to threats to the relationship and don’t exaggerate problems or place a relationship under scrutiny like someone with insecure feelings would. The personality trait of low self-esteem leaves people prone to feeling hurt and ignored and more likely to express anger and sadness, especially after disagreements. This adds more fuel to the fire by worsening arguments, promotes emotional distancing, and prevents partners from apologizing, reconnecting, and healing the relationship. Interestingly, there are people with low self-esteems that have satisfying relationships and confident people that don’t. Nevertheless, the dependence regulation model specifies key psychological processes which lead to relationship dissatisfaction.</p>\n<h2>Childhood Experiences Affect Adult Relationships</h2>\n<p>Personality traits provide valid information about the intimate relationships people will have and whether they’ll last or end. Keep in mind, not even the best personality tests can fully capture the complexity of anyone’s character or how they’ll behave in a relationship. Most of us can recognize intergenerational transmission effects; that who we are as individuals and as romantic partners was shaped by how we were raised, and relationship scientists have learned that each new generation in a family partially resembles previous generations. Experiences are transmitted from one generation of parents on to the next generation, their children, and the cycle repeats. Some of the most significant effects arise when families dissolve in say, a divorce, and then reappear in another form. We learn a lot about our partners by meeting the families they were raised in, their families of origin. For example, your partner may get their goofy sense of humor from a parent or love public displays of affection because they have parents that can’t keep their hands off of each other.</p>\n<p>The divorce rate has slightly declined since the 1980s but about half of all first marriages and an even higher amount of second marriages end in permanent separation or divorce. Not all divorces involve children, but more than one million children experience the divorce of their parents every year in the United States. About 40 percent of all children experience their parents divorcing before they become young adults. Experiences vary dramatically for different families and children in the same family can vary in their response to their parent’s separation or divorce. Five key conclusions have emerged from research on how parental conflict and relationship dissolutions affect individuals as they develop from children to adolescents, to adults.</p>\n<p>1. Parental separation or divorce often negatively affects a child’s academic achievement, conduct and behavior, psychological adjustment, self-esteem, and social relationships.</p>\n<p>2. Parental divorce approximately doubles the risk of negative consequences for children but children with parents who have an intact marriage can also experience them.</p>\n<p>3. Divorce jeopardizes a family’s economic circumstances, compromises the parents’ mental health, reduces the quantity and quality of parent-child contact, and leaves everyone involved vulnerable to new types of distress.</p>\n<p>Despite the best intentions, the quality of parenting often suffers because of a divorce, and family instability decreases the chances a child will receive the emotional support and guidance they need. Fortunately, the use of active coping skills can offset adverse effects.</p>\n<p>4. Raising children in emotionally distressed homes, even with biological parents together can negatively affect children, especially when parental conflicts aren’t properly resolved. Children exposed to higher levels of parental conflict have lower self-esteem, happiness, and life satisfaction in early adulthood compared to children exposed to lower levels of parental conflict.</p>\n<p>5. The psychological health of adult children depends on a complex combination of whether their parents divorced and the marriage’s health prior to the divorce. A study of 27-year-olds found children’s well-being is the lowest when marriages with little conflict end and when marriages with a lot of conflict do not end. Unexpected divorces decrease a child’s capacity to develop long-term trusting relationships.</p>\n<p>A complete understanding of an intimate relationships doesn’t begin when two people meet. It begins when parents meet and create a new family. Children with rocky family foundations are more cautious toward relationships and more accepting of divorce. Children of divorce may marry earlier than children not exposed to parental divorce, perhaps reflecting a desire to leave difficult family situations. They are also more likely to cohabit without marrying and delay getting married. They’re just as motivated to form intimate relationships as children from intact families but tend to be more pessimistic about marriage as the way to accomplish that goal. Children from unstable and troubled families tend to have less money and fewer friends as they complete adolescence and begin adulthood. Children of divorced parents are less likely to graduate from high school or start college. They’re also at a greater risk of unplanned pregnancies and dissatisfying relationships with their parents even later in life. Father-child relationships are particularly fragile following family breakups. Children from unstable families experience more relationship distress and dissolution themselves. Experiences they have can be linked to what happened in their parents’ relationship. Regardless of the parents’ education, income, religious views, and whether or not they divorced children whose parents were unhappy in marriage are likely to form relatively unhappy marriages.</p>\n<h2>The Social Learning Theory</h2>\n<p>Children learn about relationships from watching how family members relate to one another, their relationships with their parents, siblings, other family members, and internalize emotional and behavioral models to generalize relationships outside the family. The interpersonal styles they learn influence their adolescent and adult intimate relationships. Children exposed to various forms of abuse and neglect in childhood carry those experiences with them and based on those experiences, the quality of newlywed marriages can be predicted, including increased psychological aggression and relationship problems, and decreased trust and sexual activity. Even couples in the dating stage of a relationship with a partner from a harsh and conflicted family will have less positive behavior in communication because the person from the troubled family will have less self-control over emotions and a greater tendency to have hostile and cynical attitudes toward other people in general. Married couples discussing relationship problems, one partner being from a troubled home, will suffer because that person with a history of parental divorce will likely disagree, express disrespect and disdain for their partner, and withdraw in unproductive ways. The presence of a supportive spouse does not offset this effect, their marriages are predicted to be less fulfilling. Fortunately, children who grow up in warm, nurturing families feel more closely connected to their intimate partner 60 years later. They are able to do this by being less defensive, more realistic about life challenges, and by being more emotionally engaged with those challenges while managing them. Without a doubt, we are shaped by the ways our parents managed their emotions and conversations while we were kids but the effects of family upbringing on adult relationships vary. Many people who grow up with conflicted or divorced parents are able to create and maintain satisfying intimate relationships.</p>\n<h2>The Attachment Theory</h2>\n<p>Our attachment behavior system, an innate set of behaviors and reactions shaped by evolution, helps ensure our safety and survival and governs our capacity to form emotional bonds. For example, when your partner doesn’t respond to your cues when you want to cuddle or doesn’t say supportive things when you need a pep talk, how do you take it? Just like politicians, people in intimate relationships can spin events in constructive or deconstructive ways. Maybe they didn’t cuddle you or give you a pep talk because they knew you were strong enough to handle it yourself and had faith you could handle a situation independently. Maybe they didn’t cuddle you or give you a pep talk because the other day you didn’t wash the plates and take out the trash even though it was your turn and they’re trying to get back at you. Our internal working models affect how we interpret interpersonal events like these. People with a secure attachment style tend to minimize the impact of negative events while people with insecure attachments tend to magnify the impact of the same events. People with the most negative working models of themselves and others, fearful individuals, typically have the most pessimistic interpretations of relationship events. People who try to repress their emotions express less emotion in response to relationship events and report being less aware of physical manifestations of anger like tension and a faster heart rate. People with an anxious attachment will compensate for low self-esteem by overusing available support and might not even be satisfied by it. People prone to avoidance will adopt a defensive position and deny their need for support, they’ll use distancing strategies to cope with their distress.</p>\n<p>People with a secure attachment style approach relationship problems with more warmth, more compassion, and less hostility. They are also inclined to have open conversations with their partner when they are upset and less likely to think about breaking up. Secure partners are likely to clearly communicate needs, expect their partner will help address their needs, and gratefully accept their partners’ efforts to help. Fearful individuals do the opposite by stonewalling and closing off contact and are inclined to jump to conclusions about ending the relationship. Attachment theory provides essential clues about kinds of communication that nourish or harm relationships. The attachment behavior system isn’t always operating though, it’s activated when a person is challenged or access to their caregiver is threatened. For example, at the airport security checkpoint where only passengers can go through security, many people can be seen trying to hug and kiss goodbye until the very last minute and promising to reconnect as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>How to Overcome Insecurity</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Self-affirmations</strong></p>\n<p>Identify values that are important to you (e.g. honestly, community service, spirituality, working hard) and write about why they’re important to you, how they shape your life and play a key role in your self-image</p>\n<p><strong>2. Adopt Your Partner’s Perspective</strong></p>\n<p>Imagine what a day in your partner’s shoes is like. Describe in detail what their five senses pick up on during a typical day. What do they see, smell, taste, touch, and hear?</p>\n<p><strong>3. Elaborate on a Compliment</strong></p>\n<p>Think about a time your partner said how much they liked something about you such as a personal quality or ability, or something you did that really impressed them. Explain in detail why they admire you, what that means to you and its significance for your relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Increase Psychological and Physical Closeness</strong></p>\n<p>Work with your partner through a series of increasingly personal questions and discuss your responses together (e.g. if you were to die tonight with no opportunity to text or call anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone? Why haven’t you told them yet?) After answering deep questions and connecting over them, engage in 30 minutes of gentle stretching and yoga together (or another similar activity that fits your physical abilities and preferences such as a walk in nature).</p>\n<p><strong>5. Remember</strong></p>\n<p>Remember that simple activities can weaken the influence of insecure attachments on relationships and implement tools regularly in your daily life. Remember that regardless of how secure or insecure we feel, we all have room to improve our relationships and there are a plethora of resources at your fingertips. Be willing to research and practice them, an investment in a relationship will never be a waste!</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<h2>Matchmaker</h2>\n<p>During and after biblical times, people have sought out help with finding partners they are compatible with to build satisfying relationships. Some of the most common google searches are all centered on relationships and how to become and find a perfect 10. Matchmaking websites promise clients to use science and technology to find them compatible partners. Dating coaches promise clients to combine personal experience and intuition to find them compatible partners and coach them to be successful in their relationships. Despite technological advances, matchmaking is a market showing no signs of slowing down and continues to grow.</p>\n<p>Every single day, people pass, babies are born, hearts are broken, and people fall in love. How does this love thing take two people that were completely independent, possibly strangers, and transform them into inseparable love birds who either completely mesh in a relationship and work to spend their lives happily together or break each other’s hearts leaving each other with the task to heal and start their search for a compatible soulmate again? Let’s dive into the process of creating an intimate relationship.</p>\n<h2>Physical Appearance</h2>\n<p>We are told not to judge a book by its cover and try to do the same when looking for compatible partners but let’s be honest. The first thing we naturally notice about a person is their physical appearance. It’s not the only thing that sparks romantic interest, but it is a factor that will either make your heart beat faster and result in the dilation of your pupils or turn you off. Take a moment to self-reflect. What makes you leap from liking someone to really liking someone and wanting to be more than friends with them? The experience of desiring someone as an intimate partner, romantic attraction with or without a sexual element, is the universal experience known as the mystery of romantic attraction.</p>\n<p>When we first physically walk into a room, or log into a platform, we can’t immediately know someone’s morals, work ethic, intelligence, or sense of humor but we quickly and easily realize whether we are into someone’s physical appearance or not. Interestingly, studies have shown that college freshman will decide whether or not to go on a second date with someone based on solely physical appearance with variables like shared interests, backgrounds, and grades not seeming to matter. When college students and married couples are asked to name the attributes, they find most appealing in a potential partner, men and women rated attributes similarly except for physical attraction. Men reported valuing physical appearance more than women did. This difference was found across cultures, ethnicities, and age groups. However, this doesn’t necessarily indicate that appearance influences men more than women. Just because women don’t report caring about appearances as much as men do doesn’t mean they actually value personality over appearance or earning potential over appearance. Many women think they are more influenced by earning potential or emotional expressiveness but show they prioritize appearance when rating potential partners.  A meta-analysis of about 100 studies confirmed that perceiving a partner as physically attractive equally predicts greater romantic attraction for both the female and male gender. The difference that was confirmed between men and women was that women are more harsh when judging a man’s attractiveness and are more likely to message men that they don’t find highly attractive while men judge more equal numbers of women as highly attractive or not so attractive but are more likely to initiate conversation with the top of the women they find are the best looking. Statistics from OkCupid show the most attractive men are 11 times more likely than the least attractive men to be direct messaged while the most attractive women are 25 times more likely to receive direct messages than the least attractive women on the site.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Reality Check</h2>\n<p>If everyone wanted the best-looking people, then how would the rest of us find compatible partners we would like to start relationships with? We don’t always pursue the most physically perfect people we can find. In fact, research confirms a matching phenomenon; a tendency for people who are in a relationship or about to get married to usually be similar to each other in physical appearance. Research also explores a possible explanation for why we may or may not pursue the most visually aesthetic partner we see, how we look ourselves!</p>\n<p>Hot, attractive individuals receive more attention from everyone. Attractive people who are used to admiration tend to be more comfortable with approaching other good-looking people and are less likely to ask out people far less attractive than them. Inversely, people who are less hot might understandably fear rejection more and be more apprehensive about approaching potential partners, less likely to ask out someone who’s out of their league therefore going after a compatible person who is also less than gorgeous. The matchmaking phenomenon is supported because in real life, the desire to avoid rejection and make a connection leads people to date others similar in physical attraction. It’s not that some people care less about physical attractiveness but the role that physical attraction plays in someone’s life seeking a relationship is different than the role beauty plays in someone’s life simply seeking a one-night stand.</p>\n<h2>Why Appearance Makes Such a Difference</h2>\n<p>The role physical appearance plays in the start of a brewing romance is large, but it’s not the protagonist in a satisfying relationship. Then again, when we don’t know much about a person, we tend to correlate high physical appeal with other positive qualities. This assumption is so relevant is has been found to affect employment, favoring highly attractive individuals when their physical characteristics are on display. For example, two people with the exact same education and experience with a different level of physical attractiveness will not have the same experience during a job interview. Good looking people have a greater chance of being hired after a job interview and usually have a higher salary in their first jobs. They’re also less likely to be convicted of crimes and when they are, their sentences are usually shorter. In a study asking participants to judge strangers based on a photo, the faces that were rated as being more attractive were also assumed to be people who were more interesting, kind, and successful than the people with less attractive faces. Although other than the golden ratio based on a face’s symmetry, physical attractiveness somewhat varies across cultures, there is a universal finding that attractive people enjoy certain advantages.</p>\n<p>Concrete advantages that hotter people enjoy include but aren’t limited to social advantages like receiving more smiles and having people report feeling more positive when interacting with them. Particularly, handsome men have more conversations with women than less attractive men. Attractive women get more dates and have more sex than less attractive women. The assumption that attractive people are more sociable leads men to engage in interactions which encourage their partners to fulfill that expectation. When men believe the women they are talking to are more attractive they are more animated and friendly. When women are believed to be very attractive, they are more social and friendly. Physical appearance has a powerful influence on social interactions for both genders.</p>\n<p>Negative consequences of being attractive include but are not limited to being unfairly judged as vain and promiscuous. Also, people tend to lie about themselves when talking to better looking people so often times attractive people find it hard to trust positive feedback they receive. Evolution tries to explain the high regard for physical attractiveness with the theory that what is now attractive was once an essential indicator of good health in a compatible mate. Ironically, we now know that physical appearance does not necessarily indicate health. Being handsome or beautiful doesn’t mean someone will be fit and healthy.</p>\n<h2>Personal Characteristics</h2>\n<p>While how compatible a partner may be is not prioritized over how hot they are for a sexy fling, long-term relationships prioritize characteristics like personality and intelligence as much as attractiveness. Qualities which people can be hierarchically ranked on are called vertical attributes. For example, physical attractiveness, health, and income level are vertical attributes as having more of them is seen to be better than having less. Vertical attributes are commonly valued, especially in relationships which is why seeking compatible partners based on them will lead to rigorous competition. Contrastingly, a horizontal attribute is a quality people can differ on without being judged as better or worse than others such as food preferences, hobbies, political beliefs and career choices. Imagine being a shrimp fanatic on a date with someone who hates raw fish but loves steak tacos. One preference is not better than the other, but you might feel as compatible as you would if you shared a love for shrimp. When people describe their ideal mate, they usually describe vertical and horizontal attributes “I want someone gorgeous and wealthy who loves dogs and intellectually stimulating movies.”</p>\n<h2>Personality and Similarity</h2>\n<p>Personality is a vertical attribute, and research shows everyone wants a compatible partner that has positive traits. Universally an attractive personality is genuine, honest, loyal, intelligent, dependable, open-minded and thoughtful and an unattractive personality isn’t. It was found that being fun is not admired as much as being honest is; we are more attracted to good people than we are to fun people. Although we end up in relationships with people whose personalities resemble ours, similarity in personality plays a small role in relationship satisfaction. It’s easy to understand that happy, well-adjusted people are more attracted to other happy, well-adjusted people but there is no reason to expect depressed, neurotic people are more attracted to other depressed, neurotic people. Relationships where two people are similar in unattractive traits are less successful than relationships with people who aren’t as similar in unattractive traits. It seems complementary personalities, not similar personalities, are more likely to predict romantic attraction. However, the idea that we are attracted to people with qualities we lack, has not been supported. Introverts are not necessarily magnetized to extroverts. In general, people don’t report being more attracted to people who have qualities they don’t. Where did the belief that opposites attract come from?</p>\n<p>Perhaps happy relationships lead people to behave in compatible ways to complement each other even if they are already more similar to each other than to other people.</p>\n<p>Although complementary traits may affect how compatible people interact in public, the foundation of their attraction is mostly their similar characteristics and tendencies. We seem to value horizontal attributes like background and interests over vertical ones like personality. Consistent evidence shows a strong pattern, partners tend to date, cohabit, and marry people similar in race, education, and religion. Partners also tend to share values, attitudes and interests. Similarity in preferences and attitudes is appealing because it results in validation. When people are into what we’re into, it justifies our interests and makes us feel better about ourselves. It also makes it easier to get along, when two people enjoy the same TV shows and foods, there’s less to argue about. This is why online matchmaking sites like eHarmony, OKCupid, and Match.com emphasize similar horizontal attributes in potentially compatible partners. Interestingly, married couples with similar backgrounds are less likely to divorce but similar attitudes and interests don’t greatly predict relationship satisfaction. The findings that husbands are happier when they share values and opinions about spending free time with their wives aren’t supported enough and thus can’t be seen as a strong basis for romantic attraction. There’s are unlimited ways to find similarities between people and identifying people similar to us doesn’t narrow the amount of fish in the sea. When we’re into someone, we’ll find a bunch of preferences and traits we have in common. When there’s no spark, we won’t and will instead find endless causes of conflict. People who like each other usually perceive they have a lot in common regardless of how alike they actually are. Perception is key and perception of similarity indicates success for a relationship but even more so is a result of feeling good about a relationship.</p>\n<h2>Reciprocity and Selectivity</h2>\n<p>We naturally wonder whether someone is attracted to us while deciding whether or not we’re attracted to them. If they have the good taste to appreciate us, they’re probably cool, right? Study after study proves the finding that knowing we are liked by someone has a powerful influence on our attraction to that person even more than knowing about their traits and values. For example, one study put strangers to work in pairs to test this. One member of each pair was actually a member of the research team and was trained to treat all the actual participants the same way. After interacting for a while, each pair individually filled out a questionnaire about their experiences. While the actual participants were alone, waiting to receive their materials they could hear their partner revealing what he or she thought of them. The feedback was manipulated to be either completely positive or critical for the actual participants. The actual behavior of the research partner was always the same but when the actual participant heard their partner being positive with their report about them, they tended to like them much more than when their partner was critical of them.</p>\n<p>However, we don’t always like people more based on how much they like us. Another study proved not all liking is equally rewarding and our attraction to someone is influenced by how their opinion of us develops over time. Similar to the first study, participants worked in pairs but this time in a series of seven exercises throughout an experimental session. This time when participants overheard their partner talking about them there were four possible conditions. In the first, there was nothing but positive feedback. The partner seemed to like them from the beginning of the study and continued to until the end. In the second, there was nothing but negative feedback. The partner seemed to dislike the participant at first and continued to until the end. In the third condition, the partner expressed positive feelings in the beginning of the interaction but then expressed far less positive feelings over time until they expressed a negative opinion in the end. The fourth was the opposite, the partner began feeling negative but by the end of the 7 exercises they expressed opinions as positive as the positive feelings in the first condition. This study found the relationship between our attraction and how much someone likes us is stronger when they initially dislike us and grow to like us. If we truly find people more attractive the more they like us then the first condition with a partner that really liked the participant throughout all 7 exercises would have been the most liked, not the second. Dating works the same way, our attraction to someone can depend on how selective they are. Someone who would date anyone is not as attractive as someone who is picky but eager to go out with you again. Approval is most rewarding when we have a reason to take it personally. An eager person on a first date who immediately likes us might not be as attractive as someone who is harder to please. Kind words from someone who is kind to everyone aren’t taken very seriously as they are less likely to be personal. Someone who grows to like us more over time, or only likes is may be harder to please but when they do express liking us, we feel sure their approval is based on our personal qualities, and we love that.</p>\n<h2>Unrequited Love</h2>\n<p>Consistent with social exchange theory, we usually pursue relationships that will benefit us more than they will cost us. However, this leaves out the category of unrequited, one-way attraction. We can be extremely attracted to people who are not attracted to us at all. If we were more attracted to people who show high interest in us then theoretically our feelings for someone who clearly is not into us should fade once we’re sure they have no intention of reciprocating our feelings and desires. Unfortunately, unrequited feelings can persist even though they cause anguish and heartache. Sometimes people are even drawn to those who reject, ignore, or even abuse them. In one study on college students more than 80 percent of participants reported experiencing unrequited love. There were three identified rewards for unrequited love. The students believed their crush was exceptionally desirable, they believed their current unrequited feelings would probably become mutual eventually, and simply being in love was found to be rewarding, even if it was one-sided. The students believed if they worked hard and long enough that their faithful investment in love would be returned with interest. Modern rom-coms often portray initially rejected characters as eventually earning their happily ever after by the end of the story. With this in mind, it’s not unreasonable for someone to stay in unrequited love with someone. The appeal for winning someone over in the future regardless of initial rejection may help explain stalking. Stalking is unwanted and possibly disturbing attention from someone who wants to start or continue a romantic relationship. What increases how dangerous stalkers can be is their insistence that they’ll eventually win their targets over despite all clear evidence that there’s no mutual interest. Outside of an experimental interaction it may be difficult to communicate that initial negative feelings about someone will remain negative, no matter what.</p>\n<p>When people were interviewed about being loved by someone they did not love, any benefits were mostly outweighed by the cost of having to reject someone. People wanted to clearly communicate feelings weren’t mutual but feared hurting someone’s feelings and then feeling guilty. This led to a bunch of “it’s not you, it’s me” phrases. Unfortunately, unclear messages can result in misinterpretations that a reluctance to break a heart means some sort of reciprocated attraction and interest in a relationship. Playing hard to get is only attractive when combined with a possibility for a love game to be won, successfully resulting in a relationship. People who successfully play hard to get clearly communicate no current interest, but they could be won over with a little effort. Unrequited love offers rewards that are not exempted from the reward theory of attraction, but they are more hypothetical than real.</p>\n<h2>Knowing What You Want in a Compatible Romantic Partner</h2>\n<p>There’s a common assumption that people will end up in a relationship with someone who mostly fits the description of what they say they are looking for in a romantic partner. If Connor says he is looking for a redhead who loves to read, we’d expect that Connor’s new girlfriend is compatible with him, is a redhead, and loves to read. However, studies have found no correlation between how people rate the importance of physical appearance, earning potential, and friendliness and someone they want a second date with after speed dating them.</p>\n<p>People in happy relationships often describe having a perfect fit, implying having a partner who matches the qualities they desire in a mate. However, although results from personality scales and questionnaires about values and standards for relationships could predict who is most desirable, they didn’t predict whether two people would like each other or not. What people say they want in a partner may predict who they will respond to on a dating profile but does not indicate much about they’ll respond to when meeting someone in person. In person we quickly learn how someone makes us feel, how responsive they are to our jokes, and how our hearts beat when they’re around. Romanic attraction, often referred to as chemistry, one might feel with another person is not like online shopping. Clothes don’t have to choose you back but for a relationship, both people must decide they are compatible and choose each other.</p>\n<h2>How Context Affects Romantic Attraction</h2>\n<p>Many people claim to have a “type” when it comes to compatible partners they’re attracted to. Our preferences for partners can change depending on where we are when we meet someone who we’re interested in. The misattribution of arousal occurs when we are aroused by something but mistakenly assume our arousal is caused by a potential mate and not our environment. This helps explain why an amusement park makes for a great date. At the end of an exciting roller coaster ride, the first thing you see is your hot date! Sexual arousal inspired by an environment can be misinterpreted as romantic attraction. Research has even explored beer goggles, the idea that as time goes by and people get more drunk, the options in a bar appear more attractive. It was found that beer goggles make women appear significantly more attractive to men while it only increases women’s attraction to men half as much. There are also other factors that affect how attracted we are to someone. Sexual strategies theory predicts that our willingness to change our standards on how likely we are to hook up with someone are not the same if we are at a bar, library, or gym. A bar promotes hook ups so if that’s your goal, a bar or loud party could lead to relaxed standards and a wide variety of potential hookups. A library might remind you of different standards, even for a hookup. If however, hook ups are a stepping stone to a long term relationship for you then a bar may lead to higher standards and a narrower range of people you’re attracted to. A library could lead to relaxed standards as it may lead to finding partners willing to deepen a hookup into a long-term relationship. This was tested with men and women by asking them to imagine themselves in various places ranging from a bar, a fraternity party, a café, a classroom, a library, and a church while describing their minimum criteria for choosing who to have a one-night stand with. Men reported lower standards for places that promote hookups like bars and parties and higher standards for places that don’t promote them like churches. Opposingly, women reported the opposite, higher standards for parties and lower standards for churches. To ensure the results were consistent, people actually at these locations were asked to describe their standards for a hookup and the same results were found. Although people may think their type is unchanging, it can really vary depending on the scenario.</p>\n<h2>Making a Connection</h2>\n<p>Mate selection is the process through which a committed relationship is formed. In Western cultures, it’s expected that the mates we select to start a relationship with are people we are initially attracted to. Most people are attracted to more people than they’ll ever intimately connect with. Attraction sets the stage for a relationship but how does a true connection form and how does it result in mutual mate selection? 50 college students who’d fallen in love in the past 6 months were interviewed and the following was found. The first element was noticing the person and their desirable qualities. Then, the most mentioned part of the process, the other person indicated the attraction could be mutual. Basically, people are just waiting for an attractive person to indicate interest in them, someone has to make the first move. Mate selection beings with three behaviors, alerting one’s presence to a potentially compatible partner, establishing one’s gender, and expressing availability and interest in a relationship. The next type of indicator could be behavioral synchrony where people unconsciously mimic each other’s behaviors. Many observable nonverbal indicators work because if one is rejected, they are subtle enough to save one from complete embarrassment. They can lead to misunderstandings, where two people interpret the same signals differently. Men are more likely to rate expressions as indicators of romantic attraction which women would not. Nonverbals can lead to hurt feelings or worse.</p>\n<h2>Self-Disclosure in a Relationship</h2>\n<p>Social penetration theory says the development of a relationship is associated with the variety and deepness of information shared and its personal significance. We tend to like people who share personal details with us and vice versa, which gradually increases intimacy. The rate of self-disclosure changes throughout a relationship. At first there’s reciprocity and when one person shares personal information, the other one immediately does the same. At first. Self-disclosure is a tool for people to learn about each other but later in an established relationship, it’s a way of getting validation and support. Not all self-disclosure is viewed positively like when a person overshares too soon or will talk about themselves to anyone who will listen. The tendency for a relationship to follow the cycle of deciding to match and then broaden self-disclosure is what propels it forward.</p>\n<h2>Developing Commitment in a Relationship</h2>\n<p>There isn’t a universal sequence every relationship follows but there are turning points that indicate people are compatible and want to deepen a relationship. The beginning of a relationship’s characteristics are usually indirect while the further development is indicated by direct and explicit characteristics like an open conversation about feelings and intentions possibly with an exchange of an “I love you.” In established relationships, other indicators for increased commitment include decisions to move in together or accepting jobs allowing both partners to be near each other. The way couples react to external factors like when they’ll graduate from school or professional opportunities help explain the difference between relationships that increase commitment and those that don’t.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },

      "rendered": "<p>Sexual orientation, much like an individual’s sex, is biology-based. Our sexual orientation serves as a map that guides us when we search for intimacy. Same-gender and different-gender relationships are composed of the same basic emotional needs but the approaches same-gender couples take to fulfill those needs are remarkably unique. When attempting to understand the similarities and differences between same-gender and different-gender relationships we must keep in mind that the legal and social context of same-gender relationships is not what it once was and is continuing to change. Also, we can’t assume that a specific couple will be equally representative of any larger group. Last but not least, we have to avoid thinking that heterosexuality is what is normal and anything other than being heterosexual or in a different-gender relationship is not normal. We want to understand same-gender relationships for the sake of understanding various ways people can find and enjoy intimacy, not to measure them up to different-gender relationships as if same-gender relationships are less ideal.</p>\n<h2>Stigma and Prejudice</h2>\n<p>People with same-gender orientations are part of a minority. Like racial, ethnic, and religious minority groups they experience stigmas and prejudice. Unfortunately, same-gender individuals experience discrimination in public places like schools or workplaces but they also experience discrimination and mistreatment from their own families. They experience dramatically higher rates of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and suicidality. Similar to other minorities, even if all legal actions necessary to deem same-gender relationships accepted and stigmas decreased, same-gender relationships would continue to experience prejudice and animosity. For example, the mistreatment they experience ranges from subtle hostility like being laughed at, to not having their romantic partner welcome at family functions, being rejected from jobs because of social media including a same-gender partner, to feeling unsafe making public displays of affection. Same-gender individuals often find themselves preoccupied with worries that people will feel uncomfortable with and object to their relationship. They are often afraid that people will object to who they are because of their sexual orientation. This often leads to internalized homonegativity, a same-gender person’s negative social attitudes toward themselves. When the involuntary tendency to accept and even endorse harsh stereotypes about sexual minorities is developed, mental health is negatively affected. This results in weakened self-esteem, consequently weakening the quality of relationships which decreases the likelihood of a satisfying long-term commitment with an intimate partner. It can even make someone judgmental towards their intimate partner. Then, because they desire someone with a characteristic they reject and suppress in themselves internal conflict arises and complicates everything even more. Experiencing too much discrimination can sometimes decrease how well intimacy is enjoyed in a relationship.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Resilience</h2>\n<p>Interestingly, same-gender couples strengthen their relationships through the misfortune they overcome together, reducing the negative effects a challenge could have on them. Another way same-gender couples remain resilient is by joining supportive communities and building families of choice. Same-gender couples are likely to remain friends and continue to socialize even after the end of their relationships. This is not as common among heterosexuals who usually do not truly maintain friendships with exes after they breakup.</p>\n<h2>Communication, Cooperation, and Conflict</h2>\n<p>We have all heard that communication is key. Which is true! Communication is key in conflict management. This is especially true for same-gender couples. Most same-gender couples combat more stress, discrimination, and prejudice than the average different-gender couple. On the other hand, same-gender couples have the advantage of not having gender differences, which commonly lead to the dismantling of different-gender relationships by causing power imbalances often leaving women at a disadvantage where they may find themselves in a subservient position to men. Different-gender relationships that are committed are very similar to same-gender relationships that are committed in that both types of intimate partnerships prioritize the same traits in potential romantic partners including but not limited to loyalty, authenticity, integrity, kindness, intelligence, and humor. In addition to a similar experience with intimacy, they also argue about similar topics and make similar investments of resources into parenting. However, same-gender couples don’t need to assert their gender and as a result, they divide labor such as household chores much more equally and fairly than different-gender couples do. Instead of dividing tasks based on which gender they are commonly linked to, they promote equality and practicality by dividing tasks based on personal preference instead.</p>\n<p>Then again, if the individuals in a same-gender relationship have different work schedules or do not equally contribute to the relationship financially then they will divide their labor differently, similar to different-gender habits. However, the partner in the same-gender couple that is making a bigger contribution will probably not see their situation as unfair because they won’t link it to being in a subservient role in the relationship like someone might if they were in a different-gender relationship. They don’t assume who will do what based on gender, they actively negotiate because both partners have the same gender. The outcome of having power dynamics diminished to promote equality is that the quality of conversations increases. Same-gender relationships tend to be more equal than different-gender relationships. As a result, they tend to manage difficult conversations about conflict and challenges by using affection and humor while on the other hand, different-gender couples tend to be more aggressive, hostile, intimidating, and complain more. The status hierarchy in different-gender relationships leaves women hostile as they usually have less power than men both in and out of the context of an intimate relationship.</p>\n<h2>Sexual Activity and Sexual Exclusivity</h2>\n<p>No matter the sexual orientation or gender, the more fulfilling the sex life of a couple is, the happier the people that make up the couple will be. Studies find that lesbian couples are either not as motivated as other types of couples to have sex, have trouble initiating, or are too socialized to prioritize the other’s emotions than personal needs which leads to sexual passion sharply declining over time because of how sexual needs are repressed. Studies have not however really studied the quality of sex lesbians have been having, only the frequency that they have sex, which leaves out the unique ways that lesbians show affection. Studies have found that lesbian sexual interactions last 45-60 minutes or more to allow time for various sexual behaviors while male and female interactions typically last 15-30 minutes or less. This explains why although lesbians appear to have sex less frequently, the quality of the sex they have is higher and which is why they are more likely to experience orgasm.</p>\n<p>Another way same-gender couples are distinct is that gay men are more likely to have sexually open relationships. In a study done in 2000 60% of gay men reported having sex outside of their relationships even after making their commitments to their romantic partners official and in 45% of those partnerships studied, both partners said that having sex with someone other than their partner was ok under some circumstances. Comparable figures for married heterosexual men were 15% and 3.5%. In a study conducted in 2009 gay men said that having an agreement about whether or not to be sexually monogamous was universal and from those men, half reported being in monogamous relationships and the other half said they were in open relationships. It was found that two-thirds of the time, agreements to either be monogamous or open were kept and when partners broke an agreement, they told their partner about half the time. A 2012 report found half of gay men in their 30s in relationships lasting about 6 years were monogamous. 30% agreed to have some type of open relationship and the other 20% disagreed over how monogamous or open they actually were in their relationships. Gay men do not necessarily avoid monogamous relationships or find them to be difficult. They separate their stable, supportive, affectionate connections with their romantic partners from sexual interactions with someone other than their primary partner. 40% of gay couples aspire to maintain committed relationships while still pursuing outside sexual partners, which is far higher than the number of lesbian or male and female couples willing to explore that and maintain that. Across many interviews, gay men emphasize how they separate sex from intimate lovemaking in their relationships and how they balance their needs for stable relationships against lust for outside sexual encounters. The themes found in these interviews were mutual need for trust, appreciation from partners for individual feelings of jealousy, valuing clear guidelines set for sexual behaviors with outsiders, and honest discussion for when guidelines agreed upon are violated. The themes also addressed issues of power and control needing to be acknowledged because partners with fewer outside options or a stronger desire for sexual exclusivity can face difficulty when they agree to be in an open relationship. Some couples ask for full disclosure when outside sexual encounters occur. Other couples prefer to follow a strict “don’t ask don’t tell” policy, and some people maintain an open relationship in silence, never discussing it at all. Gay men in open relationships might have certain privileges monogamous relationships don’t offer but they also have a unique set of challenges because emotion is just as much of a natural male trait as sexual desire is.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Through a heteronormative lens, Jim Obergefell and John Arthur are the gay couple who changed the history of marriage in the United States. Ironically, Jim Obergefell does not see it that way. He simply sees himself as having been blessed enough to fall and stay in love for a long time. Many people in same-gender relationships have the fact that they are gay labeled as their most distinguishing feature but do not see it as such. However, facing stigma, prejudice, and being discriminated against so frequently creates demands on same-gender couples like internalized homonegativity which often leaves couples disagreeing on how “out” to be. Same-gender couples rely heavily on their families of choice and communities they find for the support they need and might not find as easily as different-gender relationships. People in same-gender and different-gender relationships share the same basic needs. What differentiates them is that the approaches same-gender couples take to fulfill those needs are special and unique. Same-gender couples, both gay and lesbian, emphasize equality and fairness more than a different-gender couple of a man and a woman does which allows them to cooperate and manage conflict with increased sensitivity to each partner’s needs and emotions. There is also an undeniable difference between same-gender relationships and different-gender relationships when it comes to sexual behavior. Lesbian sex tends to occur less frequently than heterosexual sex, but on average, lesbian sex lasts much longer and has been found to have a higher probability of leading to orgasm for women. Gay men report having a higher desire for sex than lesbians and heterosexuals. There is definitely something special about the way same-gender couples are intimate, manage conflict, divide labor, and maintain their love. Interestingly, it seems that sex and gender, more than the sexual orientation of individuals in a partnership, are the primary causes for this. Male and female sexuality does not fundamentally change as a result of sexual orientation, but the way they express their sexuality is different in same-gender relationships. For example, lesbian women behave differently than heterosexual women do when expressing female sexual desires, starting with prolonged time invested in sexual interactions. Gay men differ from heterosexual men by reflecting a stronger sex drive, which characterizes males in general. Both different-gender and same-gender couples find themselves questioning compatibility based on personalities, values, and beliefs. Both types of couples do their best to navigate the highs and lows of life and challenges such as how to raise one partner&#8217;s self-esteem, financial budgets, religion and spirituality, politics, etc. Just like different-gender relationships, same-gender relationships create the responsibility for partners to do their best to keep promises to each other, avoid unnecessary arguing as much as humanly possible, continuously strengthen their bond, nourish each other without forgetting self-care, and maintain intimacy with their significant others.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<h2>Gender</h2>\n<p>It once seemed like gender reveal parties were taking over Facebook. They were creative, engaging, and a big part of a relationship. Now, it seems like Facebook could be a thing of the past, along with gender reveal parties. Why has gender historically been such a crucial part of an individual’s identity and had such a big impact on a relationship? Perhaps if we explore that we will understand why gender reveal parties were created (perhaps not). We will however, dive into how gender affects a relationship. Discussions about gender have greatly changed over time. People once referred to brains as being either blue or pink. It may seem funny now that there are majors offered at Universities that are dedicated to studying gender, but the way the world used to view gender built a wall between people greater than any wall that could be built today would, should such a terrible thing occur. How truly different are women and men?</p>\n<p>By the time a baby is three months old, it already shows a clear preference for female faces. One of the first things we do when we see someone’s face is classify it as male or female. Attempting to categorize faces has become automatic in our world. Faces that are more easily recognizable as male or female are commonly perceived to be more attractive than faces that are not. This habit of boxing people in without even knowing them also includes assumptions about their socioeconomic status, stereotypes, and whether or not they are available for a romantic relationship with us. A person’s sex refers to the biological anatomy they were born with which characterizes males and females of a species. Primary sex characteristics support reproduction (i.e. genitals, sex hormones, chromosomes). Secondary sex characteristics further distinguish females from males and are further developed throughout puberty to indicate fertility and maturity (i.e. breasts, subcutaneous fat in females and facial hair, deeper voices, and larger muscles in males). Historically, research comparing and contrasting sexes in humans led to assumptions that that there were only two, male and female. There was also a binary assumption that these two sexes are divided in a way that does not change and that the two do not overlap. Contrastingly, scientists have found that many animal species have less rigid sex distinctions. For example, slugs and snails have features of both sexes and clownfish switch between the sexes throughout their lives. Modern research has found human biology to have less rigid sex distinctions than previously thought. Sure, most people have chromosomes which clearly match DNA patterns labeled as male (x and y chromosome) or female (two x chromosomes). However, some people are born with less clear DNA patterns that vary in chromosome numbers. Some people are not born with body parts that clearly fit a female category with a vagina and ovaries or a male category with a penis and testes. 1-2% of all people actually identify as being intersex and having chromosomes or physical characteristics that cannot be clearly labeled as male or female. Finding the various ways biological markers of sex in humans can behave has led to questioning of the original binary assumption that one is either male or female. Invisible to the eye and causing even more questions is the problem that most sex characteristics are invisible or hidden. We don’t see someone’s chromosomes or hormones when we first meet someone, and most of the time we don’t see someone’s genitals when we first meet them. We try to classify them as male or female based on how they behave, their clothes, accessories, and how they present themselves which is not shaped by biology but by culture. By doing this, we are no longer thinking about sex, which is based on biology, but gender which is based on attitudes, traits, and tertiary sex characteristics; behaviors a specific culture categorizes as masculine or feminine and the expectations and beliefs about acceptable and appropriate social roles for men and women. Gender expectations are everywhere and affect our daily lives. Common expectations include how people should dress, who is qualified to be the head of a household, who can be a religious leader, who can be in charge of corporations and governments, and how one should behave in a relationship. This doesn’t just affect how societies and individuals prescribe masculine and feminine behaviors for others, it strongly affects how people perceive themselves as masculine or feminine. Realizing and recognizing that gender’s a social construct supports the fact that one’s gender identity does not have to match one’s sex (biological and physical characteristics). People with a gender identity that matches their assigned sex at birth are cisgender. Transgender people make an explicit distinction between their sex assigned at birth and their gender. Sometimes altering their bodies with hormone therapy, surgery, or both to change their assigned sex to the sex that better aligns with how they see themselves. Many transgender people choose to dress differently, change their name, and ask to be addressed by a different pronoun.</p>\n<h2>Gender Expression</h2>\n<p>One does not have to identify as transgender to express their gender identity diversely. For example, the famous aviator Amelia Earhart identified as a woman, but her gender expressions were generally associated with men. She was heavily invested in her work, unwilling to commit to a relationship, wanted to keep her sexual options open, and had an inclination to disengage and assert control. There are different ways a single gender can be expressed even among people who identify as having the same gender. Researchers are working hard to describe the different ways this is possible and have expanded on the outdated idea of an opposite-sex relationship or a dimension ranging from masculine to feminine by realizing this creates problems. In a world where traits classified as masculine are respected and rewarded more than feminine ones, defining women as lacking masculine traits is not okay. Alternatively, these traits can be better understood as two distinct dimensions. Anyone can be described as relatively high or low in stereotypically masculine qualities and separately as relatively high or low in stereotypically feminine qualities. Historically, traits seen as desirable in men are associated with having power, and traits seen as desirable with women are associated with serving others. Gender stereotypes typically reinforce social structures which give control and authority to men. Interestingly, expressing so-called masculine traits predict objective career success indicators while expressing so-called feminine traits predict the ability to form a long-lasting relationship. Researchers know masculine and feminine stereotypes do not accurately distinguish between people who identify as male or female. They know that regardless of gender identity, anyone can express masculine and feminine traits to varying degrees. Androgynous people express both masculine and feminine traits. They are less restricted, thus have an advantage over people who are more stereotypically masculine or feminine. Androgynous people tend to have higher self-esteems, less anxiety and higher levels of emotional intelligence. They readily express their emotions and are more adaptable to various situations. As a result, they are more desirable partners and are more secure in their relationship. It seems every day there are less people who subscribe to the old usage of masculine and feminine labels.</p>\n<h2>The Relationship between Gender and Behavior</h2>\n<p>Gender schemas are the cognitive representations which organize ideas and beliefs about what it means to be a man or a woman. They alter how we perceive and relate to others, especially in a relationship. Studies show that when men think they are negotiating how to divide labor with a coworker they cannot see and assume is a woman they negotiate more aggressively and assign their co-worker more feminine tasks. When women were incorrectly perceived to be men in the study, they were less likely to choose feminine tasks for themselves. This means that being perceived as a certain gender affects behavior, which also affects a relationship. The two imperfect categories of female and male have historically shaped how people think about each other and about intimacy in a relationship and continue to do so. A study found that the way people present themselves on social media supports the various ways a range of behaviors, affiliations and communication habits are shaped by ideas of gender. Self-identified women mostly <span class=\"markk72qjiwsa\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">post</span>ed about friends, family, and their relationship while self-identified men mostly <span class=\"markk72qjiwsa\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">post</span>ed about objects instead of people, feeling angry and using curse words. The biological makings of women and men are pretty stable but what it means to be a woman or man varies historically, geographically, socially and culturally. For example, in the United States the idea that pink is for girls and blue is for boys was once reversed because blue was seen as delicate and pink was seen as being a stronger color. Fortunately, there have been movements which have led to more flexibility in expected and accepted behaviors of women and men in or out of a relationship, especially in western countries like the United States. For example, more women have joined the workplace and graduate from higher level learning institutions such as graduate school than ever before, and there are many more stay-at-home dads. Unfortunately, the World Health Organization has found women to continue to be described as vulnerable and men as strong and independent world-wide, which threatens the health of both women and men.</p>\n<h2>Similarities and Differences in Men and Women</h2>\n<p>Ideas and perceptions of gender are evolving but the categories, women and men, are still as powerful and influential as ever. Combining research on one variable, like whether someone identifies as a man or woman to another characteristic like empathy, aggression, or sex drive to indicate the degree of similarity between men and women on a particular characteristic. The number that captures the degree of similarity between men and women is known as a d statistic. When d = 0, men and women don’t differ on the characteristic in question. The further away d is from zero, the more men and women differ on this characteristic. Negative d values indicate women score higher than men on a specific dimension while positive values indicate men score higher. For example, men are more sexually attracted to women than women are (d= 3.<span class=\"mark32zva1fie\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">5</span>2) and that women are more sexually attracted to men than men are (d= -3.99). This supports that different-sex attraction is more common than same-sex attraction. However, d values rarely exceed 1. For the social media <span class=\"markk72qjiwsa\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">post</span>s study d= .63 meaning women and men overlapped by at least 75 percent and used similar words even though there was an average difference.</p>\n<p>On average, men are more physically and verbally aggressive than women but when provoked, d =.17. and there isn’t a big difference between how aggressive men and women are. On average, women are more skilled at expressing emotions than men, while men are more likely to make intrusive interruptions. On average, women are more likely than men to seek out emotional support to cope and discuss challenges faced. On average, women are more likely to emphasize social class and ambition when describing their preferences for a relationship partner while men are more likely to prioritize physical attractiveness. On average, women are more likely to feel anxious, guilty, and fearful about sex while men are more likely to have a more positive attitude about sex in an established relationship and even more in a casual relationship. On average, women and men reported similar levels of happiness and self-esteem. Accumulated research suggests women and men are not that different differing more in degrees in regard to a specific characteristic than in having different characteristics altogether. The average scores of women and men on social and psychological characteristics are more similar than dissimilar and when there are differences, those differences are generally small.</p>\n<p>Social scientists generally agree on validity of similarities and differences between women and men but there’s controversy on the approach to understanding what those findings mean, especially for a relationship. For example, it was found that on average men are more aggressive than women but an explanation for why was not found. What is responsible, nature or nurture? Are men biologically predisposed to being more aggressive which implies innate and unchanging differences between women and men? Is it a matter of nurture, societies and cultures providing more opportunities for men to be aggressive than women? That suggests what people believe about gender is a social construct and can be deconstructed.</p>\n<h2>Evolution’s Explanation</h2>\n<p>Evolutionarily speaking, women and men have faced similar challenges and now share various similar abilities. In order to successfully reproduce, they adapted to different challenges. Offspring require using limited reproductive resources, time, and energy during and after birth from women. Men don’t have limited reproductive resources and in fact donate from an endless supply of sperm with no comparable obligations. Even though men can and do contribute to raising children, mothers have a greater burden in reproduction. Evolution has found reproductive realities to imply the kinds of mates women and men prefer for a romantic relationship. Females prefer males who are able and willing to provide resources and protection for them and their offspring. Males prefer females that are physically attractive and youthful because male reproductive efforts are limited by the availability of healthy and fertile females. Since men don’t benefit from investing resources into children fathered by others, they seek out women who are trustworthy and faithful. These preferences are consistent cross-culturally and throughout history; women prioritize status and resources and men prioritize fertility indicated by physical attraction and youth. Intrasexual competition, the ways women and men compete for advantage in the mating marketplace also demonstrates evolved differences between men and women. Evolutionary psychology suggests differences in how women and men attract, keep a relationship, and replace partners can be explained by the unique problems our male and female ancestors faced and is consistent with modern differences today. However, anthropology fact checks certain findings of evolutionary psychology and warns us not to suggest that stereotypes about gender differences should be necessarily reversed but to be open to available data from anthropology and biology to examine what supports existing stereotypes or their exact opposite.</p>\n<h2>Learned Differences Affect Intimate Relationships</h2>\n<p>An individual’s capacity to alter the behavior and experiences of others while also resisting the influence others have on them is their power. This is extremely relevant in an intimate relationship because the roles men and women often have in society, both in the workplace and at home, are not equal. There is a disproportionate amount of men as members of the United States supreme court, as first responders in emergencies, and as CEOs of fortune <span class=\"mark32zva1fie\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">5</span>00 companies. Why? What does this unequal allocation of power and status across genders say to new generations? Social structural theory explains that differences in how money, power, and other resources are divided between women and men are important because this gender-based inequality affects social expectations for men and women such as which roles involving authority and decision making they will occupy and the steps they will take to meet expectations. Society doesn’t just teach these gender-expectations and stereotypes, it punishes those who dare to challenge the status quo. This is seen in reactions to parents who decide not to assign a gender to their children, and in violence against transgender people. When someone identifies as having a particular gender but violates social expectations for it, they are viewed less favorable and their actions are judged more harshly. Furthermore, their sexual identities are questioned. At an early age, children learn and behave according to these social restrictions to avoid being bullied. Gender-identity expectations correlated with unequal power keep people on certain paths in their intimate relationship and career lives and keep them from pursuing other paths in life. For example, when a child commits to becoming a police officer, they figure out it would make sense to behave aggressively to fulfill expectations and skill requirements for such an influential, dominant role. Contrastingly, if a child commits to a more submissive role, they’ll realize that developing cooperative and empathetic behaviors is the way to go. Patriarchal societies in which men have more power and resources than women reward men for independent and assertive behaviors while rewarding women for emotional sensitivity and sacrifice. All in all, the social structural perspective explains gender differences by examining unequal access to power and status which is reinforced by men behaving in ways that give them more superiority while women promote cooperation, nurture others, and adapt to the inferior roles available to them. Gender differences are not caused by genetic differences, they are made from social structures and maintained by unequal opportunities which place different limitations on women and men.</p>\n<h2>What This Means for a Relationship</h2>\n<p>Whether men prefer younger hot partners and women prefer older rich partners depends on how empowered women are in a particular culture and how equal men and women are viewed as being in that culture. In cultures where women are more empowered, gender differences in mate preferences are significantly smaller. As female empowerment and gender equality increase, women’s preference for older partners and men’s preference for younger ones decrease. This contradicts the assumption evolutionary psychology makes about cross-cultural mate preferences. Power structures lead to specific behaviors being associated with a particular gender. When women have more power, make more money, and hold a higher position in a company, they don’t behave the same way women without these resources do. The same can be said about the capacity for one person to accurately know what someone else is thinking, referred to as empathic accuracy. When men are told that instead of making them more feminine, empathic accuracy will actually make them more romantically appealing, they perform just as well as women do in expressing, interpreting, and decoding emotions.</p>\n<p>Even preferences about sexual behavior are not hardwired but responsive to social changes. For example, premarital sex is more widely accepted than it once was. As a result, more young adults are sexually active. Interestingly, in the 1950s only 13% of young women had engaged in sex but by the 1990s 47% had engaged in sex. During this time, the negative consequences of sex for women such as unwanted pregnancies and social judgement also decreased. Gender is an extremely weak indicator of how someone will behave, especially compared to the influence of power and social status on behavior. The fact that gender expectations and behaviors have changed over time along with experimental research supports the finding that unequal distribution of power and status is what gives birth to gender differences in most societies.</p>\n<p>Prior to the industrial revolution nobody talked about or tried to explain who was more responsible for work or family life because they were the same thing. Every member of the household, women, men, and children, contributed to the family farm. Everything changed with the development of manufacturing as family responsibilities split in two. The men left the house to work and women stayed at home to maintain the household and take care of children. Back then, both the men leaving the home to work and the women working at home were working in harsh conditions. Factory jobs that working-class men had were often flooded with safety hazards and women didn’t have washing machines, refrigerators and other helpful devices that are now available. However, men were getting paid for their work and women were not. Soon, men’s jobs were described as activities they pursued for money and status while women’s work at home was belittled as simply being their responsibility and something they did because it was in their nature. This led to the social hierarchy exaggerating the differences between life at home and the world. Worst of all, it changed the ideal personalities of women and men and made women financially dependent on their romantic relationship.</p>\n<p>Now, research has found that men have strong physiological responses when their competence or dominance is threatened while women respond more strongly when experiencing disagreements in their relationship.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Awareness</h2>\n<p>The way men and women have been socialized to establish and maintain intimacy even affects how aware of their relationship they will be. For example, if Isabel and Christian introduce each other to their families, they will probably discuss how they met, and how their first date went. Isabel is likely to recall more accurate details and speak through the perspective of the couple than Christian is, because on average, women are more aware of their relationship than men are. Women develop mental representations of their relationship that are emotionally richer which explains why men are 8-10 times less likely than women to know why they are getting a divorce.</p>\n<p>A summary of eight studies using a diary method and rankings to rate interactions with male friends versus female friends from 1 for superficial to 7 for meaningful shows that on average, men rate their interactions with their other men 3.4, and women rate their interactions with other women 4.2. Thus, men are not less capable of deep dialogue or expressing their feelings, they are just less likely to do so with other men. This is also seen in an intimate relationship such as a marriage. When asked to be supportive, husbands and wives provide virtually the same amount of positive, neutral, and negative behaviors. Men don’t lack the basic skills for expressing their emotions or being supportive, they can step up when a situation calls for it but, are likely to increase criticism when they increase support. For example, if Joseph’s wife Nicole vents about not having the time and effort she invests in her work valued by her supervisor, Joseph is likely to validate her feelings but criticize her, “ I know your supervisor doesn’t seem to value how hard you work or the work you do, life can suck, but I told you to quit months ago.” Men are not incapable of emotional work women do, they are just less likely to do it because they are discouraged from doing so, told it’s not their job, and risk being perceived as weak or less manly. Women are rewarded for empathic accuracy and nurturing those around them and are told it is their job in the relationship. Research on caregiving has even found that if a husband has a wife with cancer, he will have the same stress level as a husband with a wife that doesn’t have cancer while a wife with a husband who has cancer will be just as distressed as the husband battling the cancer.</p>\n<h2>Interest in Sex</h2>\n<p>Fortunately, physiologically speaking, women and men have sexual response cycles that are nearly identical. They are also equally physiologically capable of experiencing sexual pleasure and orgasm. Unfortunately, women and men receive vastly different messages about how acceptable it is to enjoy sex. From a young age, men are culturally pressured to want sex, pursue sex, and be ready for sex when an opportunity arises. Women receive contradicting messages and are shamed for expressing too much interest in sex or for expressing too little. They are encouraged to be seductive to men but to be chaste and pure. The media then further complicates things by portraying unrealistic body standards which leaves women unhappy with and ashamed of their bodies. We live in a world where sex is frequently a source of distress, threat and possible trauma for women on top of possibly causing unwanted pregnancies but also a world where sex is a source of rewarding pleasure for men. Since women face many disadvantages that men do not when it comes to physical intimacy, they are not given the same opportunity men have to holistically enjoy it. Acknowledging how socially and physically risky sex can be for women is the first step in a proper attempt to understanding gender differences in sexual interest and behavior, such as why men are more motivated to have sex. Research has found extensive lists of behaviors emphasizing gender differences in sexual behaviors and physical intimacy as including but not being limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Men have more spontaneous thoughts about sex in a day.</li>\n<li>Men have more sexual fantasies than women.</li>\n<li>Men have more varied sexual fantasies women have.</li>\n<li>Men want to have sex more frequently than women do.</li>\n<li>Men want a more sexual partners than women do.</li>\n<li>Men masturbate more than women do.</li>\n<li>Men self-report an interest in a wider variety of sexual practices than women do.</li>\n<li>Men are less willing to pass up the opportunity to have sex.</li>\n<li>Men are more willing to make greater sacrifices than women for sexual opportunities.</li>\n<li>Men are more likely than women to initiate sex.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Research also shows that women are more judged and stigmatized for engaging in the exact same behaviors men are praised for. Regardless of their gender, people perceive a woman who accepts an invitation to have sex with a stranger as less intelligent, less mentally healthy, and more promiscuous and riskier than a man who accepts the same invitation. Women are not blessed with the social and cultural support that men receive for pursuing and enjoying sex but are cursed with a greater threat of violence and social judgement than men are. With this in mind, it’s not hard to understand why even though women and men have an equal physiological capacity for sexual pleasure, women are on average less inclined than men to pursue or enjoy sex.</p>\n<h2>Ending a Relationship</h2>\n<p>Women are more likely than men to be aware of their relationship and are more likely to recognize problems in the relationship. This coincides with how women accept the need for relationship counseling earlier than men do and are more likely to initiate contact with practitioners and or more likely than husbands to want a divorce, bring up filing for one, and to actually file for a divorce. Women are socialized to be more sensitive than men to the quality and stability of their relationship and will likely be the first to detect what’s wrong with their relationship. Women are more likely than men to be financially dependent on their relationship partners and understandably so, if your survival depends on someone else caring for you, you’re going to make sure your relationship is solid, or you will find another romantic partner.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Once expectations about roles and responsibilities in a romantic relationship are recognized as being negotiable in a relationship and not pre-determined by society or culture, couples will have to question what many generations have, dare I say, blindly accepted and implemented about an intimate relationship. Some couples may experience distress because challenging our assumptions about gender can be confusing and threaten what we see as normal. Other couples will be able to breathe better and be more satisfied with their relationship once they are liberated and embrace an opportunity to choose how sensitive, aggressive, emotional, sexual, independent, and connected they will be as individuals, and as a happy couple in their relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",
