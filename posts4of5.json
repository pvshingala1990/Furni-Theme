      "rendered": "<h2>Social Exchange Theory</h2>\n<p>Unlike the evolutionary perspective and attachment theory, social exchange theory is mindfully focused on the present. It focuses on how people make decisions, make an investment in, and evaluate their relationships in the present moment. It was born in the 1960s after principles of sociology, anthropology and psychology were combined with psychologist B.F Skinner’s behaviorism which expands ideas on rewards and punishments leading to a broader movement in psychology and ultimately a description of social interactions in economic terms. According to social exchange theory everyone tries to get the most out of every social interaction by exchanging social goods such as information, status, and approval. It even predicts what people will do in social situations by specifically identifying how an investment in a relationship and behaviors will pay off and how people will feel about the outcomes of their actions. It predicts if an investment will be worth it. It is used to understand behaviors not only in administrations, jails, or hospitals but in intimate relationships. For example, relationship satisfaction can be seen as subjective to an individual in a particular relationship, but social exchange theory evaluates what a partner is receiving from into a relationship during a specific time. It then compares it to each investment a partner makes into a relationship during a specific time. Relationship stability is seen as the result of each partner’s decision to stay in a relationship and nourish it or end it. Through a social exchange lens, the negotiation of costs and rewards in a relationship determines how a relationship will grow and flourish or decay. A spotlight on how important and relevant social exchange theory is that Gary Becker, who researched costs and rewards which lead to marital decisions received a Nobel Peace Prize in economics.</p>\n<h2>Interdependence in Intimate Relationships</h2>\n<p>Two psychologists, John Thibaut and Harold Kelley were the first to introduce the defining feature of all relationships to be how interdependent partners are; how much one partners actions affect the other partner. Thus, they referred to their perspective on social exchange theory as interdependence theory as it focused on romantic relationships. They were most interested in the effects of interdependence and the rules which predict how interdependent partners will interact, and how the partners will assess the results of their actions. Social exchange theory’s fundamental assumption about intimate relationships is that people evaluate and make decisions about their relationships just like they evaluate and make economic decisions. They decide whether or not to make an investment in a relationship similar to how they decide to make an economic investment. This approach defines the ways a relationship fulfills the needs and desires of a partner as rewards and the elements of the relationship which prevent partners from fulfilling their needs or desires as costs. We, humans, seek to maximize rewards and minimize costs as much as possible and are usually pretty good at finding ways to do so in every situation.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Rewards</h2>\n<p>The potential rewards an intimate relationship may provide are often broken down into material rewards and social rewards. For example, a relationship may provide material rewards like food and protection and social rewards like emotional and psychological support through companionship, validation, and security. On the other hand, the potential costs of an intimate relationship include the exact opposite of potential rewards. For example, financial drain, emotional and psychological pain through frequent conflicts, trust issues, especially concerning jealousy, and even physical abuse. Even high-quality relationships involve costs. Intimate relationships require an investment of time and energy, leaving less time for pursuing other interests and often also costing each partner opportunities to explore alternative relationships. Costs like missing out on getting to know other attractive potential partners, job opportunities that would require relocating away from a partner, or even hobbies that a partner would disapprove of and request be discontinued are referred to as opportunity costs. Analyzing the pros and cons, the rewards and costs of an intimate relationship can be hard. Most relationships do not consist of only rewards or only costs, they have a combination of the two. For example, you might enjoy cuddling and being silly with your partner but extremely dislike the way they take too long in the shower or have a hard time adjusting your habits like not blasting music to avoid bothering them. Social exchange theory breaks this process down and clarifies it with the following formula:</p>\n<p align=\"center\">OUTCOME = REWARDS &#8211; COSTS</p>\n<p>Perhaps friends and family have asked you to determine whether you should stay in a relationship or not. However, standards for comparing how rewarding rewards or how costly costs in a relationship are do not exist. Most people would not pursue an intimate relationship if they predict it will make them miserable but there’s no way of knowing exactly what the rewards or costs of a relationship will be in advance. Outside of fairy tales, people have to rely on a combination of what their gut intuitively tells them about a relationship, their past experiences with intimacy, and external factors like guidance from friends and family to estimate how rewarding or costly a relationship will be. They have to decide whether or not the investment they are inclined to make will lead to satisfaction. Subjective probability is your guess of how rewarding or costly a relationship will most likely be. Keeping this in mind, perceived rewards or costs that are easily believable are more likely to influence subjective probability because a smaller reward that you are likely to receive is more appealing than a bigger reward that you will probably not receive. This is why instead of infatuating over a relationship with celebrities, people tend to turn towards their social circles and make an investment there when looking for intimate partners.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Just because the rewards of a relationship outweigh the costs does not mean partners are satisfied enough to continue to make an investment in and remain in the relationship. Social exchange theory says satisfaction in a relationship is evaluated by a partner comparing the perceived outcomes of their relationship with a standard comparison level (CL); in other words, with what they think they deserve. Having positive experiences with intimate relationships is not enough, we seek to have the positive outcomes from intimate relationships exceed what we think we deserve. We want a return on our investment that is higher than what we invested. When a watermelon seed is planted, a watermelon is expected. If a watermelon seed is planted and a watermelon does not grow, the seed is then evaluated as an investment that did not pay off. When we do not experience a relationship that makes us happier than we think we deserve to be, even if it’s a positive relationship, chances are we will be dissatisfied. An equation to determine this is:</p>\n<p align=\"center\">SATISFACTION = OUTCOME – Comparison Level (CL)</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, this equation attempts to determine the satisfaction a relationship results in, which has subjective factors like a predicted outcome and a standard comparison level of what an individual believes they deserve. This is why different people reach drastically different conclusions about the same relationship. Different people will have various opinions about how to make an investment in the same relationship. Think of someone whose investment in a relationship is less than what they get out of a relationship. They are in an intimate relationship which appears to have more rewards than it does costs relationship but isn’t satisfied with it and complains about it all the time. Imagine this person has a highly intelligent, ambitious, friendly, caring, attractive partner which manages conflict constructively. Doesn’t that sound ideal? Their comparison level is so high that a relationship that others would be more than happy to have does not make them happy. Contrastingly, think of someone who is happy in a relationship that appears to have more costs than it does rewards. This person is making a great investment but the return they are receiving is not so great. Imagine this person has an inconsiderate, greedy, lazy, and rude partner. Their comparison level is so low that they don’t expect the negative outcomes of their relationship to be as negative as they really are.</p>\n<h2>Miss Independent?</h2>\n<p>Social exchange theory doesn’t just touch on how people feel about their intimate relationships or rate their intimate partners. It also examines how people behave in their relationships, specifically, whether they choose to continue to make an investment in or end a relationship. How satisfied a person is with their relationship is independent of whether or not they will stay in it. The way satisfaction is calculated depends on how partners assess their relationship. How much a person depends on a relationship is directly linked to the available alternatives to the relationship, including being alone. No one wants to feel caged in a relationship. Feeling too free to leave a relationship, however, is correlated with how committed partners will be to stay in a relationship and continue to make an investment in it. The way an individual perceives potential alternatives to a relationship is referred to as the comparison for alternatives (CL<sub>alt</sub>). For example, whether a young woman named <span class=\"markb9bqylrap\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">Valentina</span> has high or low standards for her current intimate relationship, and whether or not she is satisfied with the relationship, she is dependent on her current relationship to the extent that its outcomes are better than the outcomes available elsewhere.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">DEPENDENCY = OUTCOME – CL<sub>alt</sub><sub> </sub></p>\n<p>Even if <span class=\"markb9bqylrap\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">Valentina</span> is in a happy relationship with Gianni, and to many outsiders, a relationship with a man like Gianni appears satisfying and worth maintaining, it might not be hard for her to leave the relationship. Let’s make this “<span class=\"markb9bqylrap\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">Valentina</span>” a famous actor and model. No matter how satisfying her relationship is or how positive the outcomes of the relationship could be, because of her high comparison level alternatives (CL<sub>alt</sub>) is she is aware that equally positive or more positive outcomes are available to her elsewhere since she has access to more alternatives than the average person does. This also decreases the chances she will be dependent on the relationship even though it may be extremely satisfying. People with exceptionally high comparison level alternatives (CL<sub>alt</sub>) like Brad Pitt often make decisions the general public does not understand. Brad Pitt’s exceptionally high comparison level alternatives (CL<sub>alt</sub>) can help us understand why shortly after divorcing Jennifer Aniston he began an intimate relationship with another gorgeous and talented actress, Angelina Jolie. The average person does not have the comparison level alternatives (CL<sub>alt</sub>) that a celebrity like Brad Pitt does which helps explain why people stay in unsatisfying and even toxic, abusive relationships.</p>\n<h2>Comparison Level Alternatives in Relationships</h2>\n<p>An important thing to understand is comparison level alternatives (CL<sub>alt</sub>) are not necessarily alternate relationships. Alternatives to an intimate relationship include all alternatives to being in that specific relationship, which includes the obstacles one would have to overcome like family members pushing for a relationship and even being single. Another powerful obstacle to overcome when wishing a relationship would end is finding secure income, as many partners rely on each other to maintain a household and ensure all bills get paid. Furthermore, the time, energy, and other resources that have been invested into a relationship often keep people in relationships that don’t make them happy simply because they don’t want to “lose” the resources they invested into the relationship. Relationships that involve children often push people to stay in the relationship even if it doesn’t make them happy because children, a shared home, and the time invested would possibly be lost or threatened. Barriers like these, which act as external forces keeping partners together and substantial investments in a relationship reduce the attractiveness of leaving a relationship. Thinking about relationships through the lens of the social exchange theory may appear to take the romance out of intimate relationships but the external forces keeping a relationship going, forcing two potentially people unhappy with their intimate relationship only become apparent once partners consider leaving the relationship. If <span class=\"markb9bqylrap\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">Valentina</span> and Gianni’s relationship is not satisfying them, they will think about how their relationship has few rewards and more costs, making ending the relationship a real possibility. In satisfying relationships, partners mostly focus on rewards like love and companionship as the reasons for why they stay together. If <span class=\"markb9bqylrap\" data-markjs=\"true\" data-ogac=\"\" data-ogab=\"\" data-ogsc=\"\" data-ogsb=\"\">Valentina</span> and Gianni’s relationship includes high attraction and is high in satisfaction, then they won’t focus on measuring every single investment they make and will pay less attention to alternatives to their relationship.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Commitment</h2>\n<p>Defining the difference between satisfaction and dependence breaks down the reasons why one might stay in an intimate relationship. Partners are satisfied and want to stay in it, or they are dependent and have to stay in it. Commitment, the intention to stay in and connected to a relationship is the sum of all internal and external factors which keep a relationship alive.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">COMMITMENT = SATISFACTION + DEPENDENCE</p>\n<p>The more a relationship has positive outcomes, the more things in the relationship are fulfilling  and partners feel the love they are receiving exceeds their comparison level (CL) and those outcomes are better than the comparison level alternatives (CL<sub>alt</sub>) the higher the probability is that partners will be committed to their relationship.</p>\n<p>Research on intimate relationships has been guided by the equations that social exchange theory shows to help explain how people behave in various relationships and how likely they will continue or end a relationship. There are many memes on the internet about partners that appear committed to a relationship holding their partner’s hand while looking at hot singles nearby. Census data has proven that partners with less perceived alternatives to their relationship are more likely to stay in the relationship. In the same manner, singles that live in neighborhoods containing a lot of eligible partners are more likely to marry and divorce while singles living in neighborhoods containing fewer eligible partners are less likely to get married and less likely to divorce if they are married. Science on intimate relationships no longer only inspects individual qualities in partners when a relationship ends, assuming that character flaws led to the relationship ending. Thanks to the social exchange theory, science on intimate relationships has now broadened its studies to also include external variables that may keep partners together or draw them apart.</p>\n<h2>Eyes Are Windows to the Soul</h2>\n<p>Interestingly, modern science often finds evidence to prove what our ancestors tried to teach us. Social exchange theory examines how committed partners behave in relationships when they are satisfied or dependent on their relationship. When partners are committed, it shows in their eyes and in their actions. While pupils dilating while looking at a significant other might not be widely accepted as evidence of love, the conscious decision to protect and maintain a relationship is more easily observed through actions. For example, partners in committed relationships are less likely to look at alternative partners the way they look at their significant other. When asked to rate the physical attractiveness of alternative partners, committed partners rate alternative partners lower than single people would rate those same people. Committed partners diminish the value of alternatives to their intimate relationship and are consequently more satisfied with their relationships. They also are more willing to make sacrifices for their partner and forgive their partner’s wrongdoings. Additionally, they are more likely to manage conflict constructively even when they feel dissatisfied with the relationship because they believe the relationship is worth more than leaving the relationship. Committed partners evaluate the costs of leaving their relationship as being worse than the costs of maintaining their relationship and the rewards of the investment they make in their relationship as being far better than the rewards of leaving the relationship. Happily committed partners take pride in each investment they make in their relationship because their goal is not to win arguments or to squeeze everything they can out of their partner, but to improve how they love their partner each and every single day.</p>\n<h2>Economics in Intimate Relationships</h2>\n<p>Social exchange theory does not take the beauty out of love or rename romance as a fair tradeoff. It provides a broad framework for addressing the various factors which affect whether a relationship will succeed and prevail or fail and end. It repackages psychological variables that can be subjective such as personal view of a significant other, feelings of love, alternatives to the relationship, cultural and social norms and standards, and even socioeconomic status by proposing a way to evaluate them as economic variables, which facilitates the age-old process of evaluating the pros and cons of a relationship to determine if an investment is worth it. It can be assumed that seeds for relationships are planted because both partners predict an investment will indeed be worth it. They both predict many rewards, few costs, and outcomes that are more appealing than their comparison levels (CL). Social exchange theory acknowledges that the opinions of a partner about their relationship can change over time possibly leading to a decline in relationship satisfaction when the anticipated rewards are less attractive or less obtainable and new costs are discovered. However, it does not address these questions or try to explain how an initially satisfying relationship becomes less satisfying. It focuses on how couples trying to figure out whether to continue to make an investment in or end a relationship can determine what is most rewarding for them and will lead to the most satisfaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },

      "rendered": "<h2>Relationship Attachment Theory</h2>\n<p>Many mushy metaphors about intimate relationships are cute but don’t explain how experiences in early childhood serve as building blocks for future relationships. Regardless of whether or not Mercury is in retrograde, some people tend to repeat relationship habits without noticing.</p>\n<p>Attachment theory examines an individual’s childhood to understand the foundation for their experiences with relationships as adults. According to attachment theory, the bonds we make with our primary caregivers during infancy and early childhood shape the intimate relationships we have as adults.</p>\n<h2>Fundamental Relationship Assumptions</h2>\n<p>Mainstream music on the radio commonly refers to our innate need for love and affection. Humans are not capable of feeding and protecting themselves during childhood, they need constant care. Although over the years independence increases for most people, their core need for healthy relationships does not. Babies don’t need tutorials on how to cry or smile, they naturally engage in behaviors to draw attention from attachment figures that can feed and protect them during their childhood. Creating and maintaining an attachment with an attachment figure that provides a child with comfort and care sets the tone for how future relationships will be created and maintained. How sensitive a caregiver is to their child’s cries is also evolutionary adaptive.</p>\n<h2>The Relationship Attachment Behavior System</h2>\n<p>The attachment behavior system is like an internal control system which children use to monitor three key variables:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Their internal states</li>\n<li>Their caregiver’s availability and responsiveness</li>\n<li>The presence of threats in the environment</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This system serves as a guide to increase behaviors that maximize physical proximity to a caregiver and the feeling of security. Children with parents that respond to their needs are more likely to grow up and successfully reproduce. They feel safe from threat or harm and secure enough to explore their environment, whether that’s playing with toys or making friends. On the other hand, children that don’t react or behave in a way that ensures they will be taken care of during their childhood, or that have insensitive caregivers are less likely to successfully reproduce or have fulfilling relationships. When children feel their security is threatened, their fear and anxiety usually motivates them to try to restore closeness with their attachment figure. However, sometimes their fear and anxiety hyperactivates their attachment behavior system, leaving them terrified of abandonment. When children aren’t able to restore their relationship with their caregiver, their attachment behavior system deactivates the usual behaviors and reactions they use to get the attention and care they need. This further hinders their drive to restore closeness with their caregiver. Ideally, a reunion with their primary caregiver will occur and anxiety levels will return to normal and the cycle will reset.</p>\n<h2>Relationship Attachment Models</h2>\n<p>There are two main ways children can be programmed depending on how their caregivers treated them. Infants with responsive caregivers who are consistently warm and sensitive, especially when infants are upset, grow up believing they are worthy of love and attention, and that people are generally caring and dependable. Infants with inconsistent or harsh caregivers that are controlling, unpredictable, or overly intrusive when infants are upset, grow up believing they are unworthy of attention and affection and that caregivers are not dependable or trustworthy. Experiences with caregivers during our childhood pile up to create a working model in us. This working model is like an internal psychological structure which represents subconscious and conscious beliefs, expectations, and how people feel about themselves, others, and relationships. Think about the relationships you have seen. There have been connections found between how people relate to their partners and how they relate to their children. This supports that the attachment behavior system in intimate relationships and caregiver-child relationships are the same. Internal working models link childhood experiences with caregivers to adult romantic relationships.</p>\n<p>The bridge to adulthood that most people walk on is full of fog, which causes a shift in their perspective, especially, in priorities. The focus of attachment is less on parental figures and more on a romantic partner. We rely less on physical proximity as we paint a mental picture of who people are and what they mean to us. Technology helps with this by providing us with physical pictures of a romantic partner, which reminds us of the intimate bond and comforts us when we want to see them but can’t. Internal working models continue learning and we adapt according to new experiences in relationships, which continue affecting subsequent relationships. The domino effect is a good way to visualize how good or bad experiences in relationships affect future relationships. For example, getting lied to or cheated on in a long-term relationship can shift a secure person to being more insecure about future relationships. The good news is, this means an insecure person who is blessed with an unconditionally supportive and understanding partner can shift to being more secure about future relationships.</p>\n<p>Working models rely on existing information to frame new information. For example, an insecure individual usually believes they are unlovable and may never have a happy fulfilling relationship after a relationship fails, while a secure individual usually attributes the relationship failure to external factors, like bad timing and more easily accepts a lack of chemistry with someone. Working models regulate the expression and resolution of attachment needs.</p>\n<p>Two key functions of the attachment behavior system result in precise differences in how individuals desire and prefer closeness in intimate relationships. The first function allows individuals to detect threats in the environment; feelings of anxiety cause children to seek closeness to their caregiver. When children have constant exposure to an inattentive parent who unavailable, or inconsistent and unpredictable, they develop internal working models which result in chronic anxiety, insecurity, and sensitivity to rejection and abandonment. Such experiences may result in a low sense of self-worth and doubts about deserving love.</p>\n<p>The second function is about whether or not an individual believes their caregiver is available and how likely an individual will turn toward or away from other loved ones when distressed. Usually when children get anxious, they turn toward their caregiver unless they are used to rejection from that caregiver. Instead, that child will have a perspective that warns against trusting others, against attaching, and ultimately lead to unsatisfactory relationships.</p>\n<h2>Four Broad Attachment Styles</h2>\n<p>According to attachment theory, the two main ways adults are different is measured by two dimensions: anxiety and avoidance. A tendency with anxiety about perceived threats to the attachment relationship by a child corresponds with a negative self-view. Another tendency is for avoidance of anxiety about attachment, which corresponds with a pretty negative view of others.</p>\n<p>Think of Internal working models about attachments as a coin with two different sides. Anxiety, with generalized beliefs about one’s value and self-worth is represented by one side. The other side represents avoidance and generalized beliefs about the dependability and trustworthiness of others to meet one’s needs. Combinations of these two different dimensions result in four broad attachment styles: secure, preoccupied, dismissing, and fearful. About 60% of people have a secure attachment style and the rest have different variations of the three insecure attachment styles. Around 70% of people have stable attachment styles throughout their lives.</p>\n<h2>Which Attachment Style Do You Identify With?</h2>\n<p>Humans are motivated to seek comfort and closeness through relationships with others.</p>\n<p>According to evolution, attachment styles are not optional. They are, however, generally stable across different relationships over a lifetime, with the exception of disrupting and difficult life events like death of a caregiver, chronic illness of a caregiver, and experiences involving intimacy and trust during adolescence. We are all affected by our nature and the way we are nurtured. Research shows the same findings about attachment styles and attachment behaviors for same-sex and different-sex couples. A “secure” person will not focus on problems in their relationships or be as agitated discussing those perceived problems like an “insecure” person will. When experiencing relationship conflict, a “secure” person’s view of the relationship is less likely to change than an “insecure” person’s view, which is likely to be very negative while experiencing relationship conflict. A “secure” person is likely to directly communicate their needs in a relationship while a “highly avoidant” person, seeking an intimate relationship will be more indirect. Ironically, “insecure” people have a tendency to perceive more threats and have excessive concerns about their relationships and escalate conflict, which lowers the chances of a relationship succeeding. Some people seem hardwired to “easily” navigate human intimacy but in the end, we are all yearn for comfort and closeness, we just have different approaches to reaching our goals in intimate relationships.</p>\n<p>Note: For this self-check, keep in mind that “anxiety” refers to how much people worry about whether or not other will provide them with care and “avoidance” refers to how much people seek others or keep to themselves.</p>\n<h3>Secure Attachment Style</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low attachment related anxiety</li>\n<li>Low attachment related avoidance</li>\n<li>Positive view of self</li>\n<li>Positive view of others</li>\n<li>Feel worthy of other’s love</li>\n<li>Confident others will be responsible and dependable</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Preoccupied Attachment Style</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>High attachment related anxiety</li>\n<li>Low attachment related avoidance</li>\n<li>Negative view of self</li>\n<li>Positive view of others</li>\n<li>Depend on love from others to reassure, and validate who they are through attention, e.g. rejection leads to doubting self-worth)</li>\n<li>Confident others will be caring and dependable</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dismissing attachment style</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Low attachment related anxiety</li>\n<li>Low attachment related avoidance</li>\n<li>Positive view of self</li>\n<li>Negative view of others</li>\n<li>Deny need for closeness and intimate relationships, avoid closeness, and belittle its importance to maintain a positive self-view and negative view of others</li>\n<li>Not confident others will be caring and dependable</li>\n<li>Value independence and self-sufficiency</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fearful attachment style</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>High attachment related anxiety</li>\n<li>Low attachment related avoidance</li>\n<li>Negative view of self</li>\n<li>Negative view of others</li>\n<li>Feel unworthy of care and consideration from others</li>\n<li>Seeks validation from others</li>\n<li>Confident others will be responsible and dependable</li>\n<li>Expect pain and rejection from relationships</li>\n<li>Avoid intimacy and expected discomfort in relationships</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Anxiety can be helpful when it motivates you to accomplish tasks, but it is hurtful when it causes you to avoid what you need to do. Furthermore, when one or both partners are feeling anxious it can sometimes negatively affect the relationship. Maybe one or both of you are nervous about how things are going in the relationship but avoid discussing it because it feels uncomfortable. Alternately, anxiety may make you less productive such that your worries get in the way of accomplishing work or household tasks, which can cause tension in the relationship.</p>\n<p>Below are common cycles couples experience around anxiety as well as tips for breaking out of these cycles. Because every couple is different, it’s important to read through each cycle. You might find that more than one applies to your or your partner’s behavior.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Anxiety that Creates Accommodation</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sometimes, instead of creating outward conflict between the two partners, the non-anxious partner changes his/her behavior to help the anxious partner reduce his/her anxiety. While this can be good in small doses, it can become a problem if the entire relationship becomes organized around the anxiety – a process called “accommodation”. For example, if one person is afraid of being in crowded places, the other partner may start to do all of the shopping and related activities. While that might feel good to the anxious person in the short term (even being viewed as a caring act), it ultimately keeps the anxious person from having the very experiences that would help him/her get over that anxiety.<br />\n</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Non-Anxious Partner</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The more anxious your partner gets, the more you feel you have to be reassure him/her or rearrange everything so he/she won&#8217;t get upset, which can be very stressful for you. </span><span class=\"s1\">Tips to change these situations:</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1. DISCUSS YOUR PLAN</span></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before you do anything differently, talk with your partner about why it’s important to change the way the two of you act because of your partner’s anxiety. Be sure to communicate that you really care for your partner. But it’s because you care that you’re going to try to let your partner handle his/her anxiety more independently.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">2. STOP ACCOMMODATING </span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Instead of reassuring your partner that everything is okay and/or taking any tasks to help your partner feel less anxious, step aside and give him/her the chance to practice doing things that make him/her anxious despite feeling distressed.<br />\n</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">3. DISENGAGE YOURSELF</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you find yourself wanting to help your partner with avoiding anxiety-provoking situations, or find yourself &#8220;walking on eggshells&#8221; to make sure he/she is okay, do something else that&#8217;s important to you instead. Try taking a walk, reading a book, or engaging yourself in some other pleasurable activity.<br />\n</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">4. SHOW LOVE</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you have a partner who is anxious, sometimes one of the ways you show your love is through helping with rituals or helping them avoid feared things. Instead, show you care with other actions. Leave him/her a supportive note on the mirror in the morning, give him/her a back rub after a long day, or text them to show you are thinking about him/her during the day. And, when your partner is anxious, be sure to support him/her.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Anxious Partner</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The more your partner gets stressed out when you&#8217;re anxious, the more anxious you feel, and the more you want to do something else to make the anxiety go away. </span><span class=\"s1\">Tips to change these situations:</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">1. TRY IT ON YOUR OWN</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you feel pulled to ask your partner for reassurance that everything will be fine, or help you with something that makes the anxiety go away, try not asking and instead try to stick it out. Though you will likely feel more anxiety right away, in many cases you’ll see that directly addressing the issues that make you anxious eventually <i>reduces</i> your anxiety of those issues in the future. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">2. TEST YOURSELF</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sometimes, when we have been avoiding something for a really long time, when we re-visit it, the feared thing isn’t as scary as we thought. See if you can try out some of the anxiety provoking activities or situations, and make baby steps toward doing more and more activities that used to make you anxious! </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">3. LET YOUR PARTNER OFF THE HOOK</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the reasons your partner helps you (more than might be good for you) is that he/she really cares about you and wants to help you when you feel anxious.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>So, let your partner know that you’re going to try to handle the anxiety on your own.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And let him/her know that’s not because you don’t appreciate the help but that it’s because your anxiety won’t improve if you don’t push yourself.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">4. SEEK OUT HELP</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Would advice from a therapist or physician be an option for you? There are many effective therapies and medications shown to help people struggling with anxiety. Additionally, self-help books or other online programs</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Anxiety that Creates Conflict</span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">The anxious partner’s behavior can bother the non-anxious partner. The non-anxious partner may try to help, but if the help he/she offers isn’t what the anxious person wants, he/she can start to feel frustrated. At the same time, if the anxious partner notices the non-anxious partner’s frustration, his/her anxiety might become even worse. Attempts to decrease anxiety may just start the cycle all over again.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Non-Anxious Partner</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The more anxiety your partner shows, the more concerned and frustrated you become, and the more you urge him/her to relax and fix the problem. </span><span class=\"s1\">Tips to change these situations:</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">1. UNDERSTAND IT</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Try to empathize with the anxiety your partner is feeling. If this isn’t a core issue you’re working on in this program, tell your partner you see how difficult it must be for him/her to deal with this. Having an open conversation about how difficult it is for you both can start moving things in a more productive direction and out of the frustrating cycle. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">2. DON’T JUDGE</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Try not to criticize your partner &#8211; that is likely to make his/her stress and anxiety worse. Give your partner some time to figure out how to handle his/her anxiety. Be open to the ideas they share about how you can react constructively. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">3. FOCUS ON SELF-CHANGE</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Make decisions about things you can control, like what <i>you&#8217;ll </i>do when your partner is feeling anxious. Maybe you can remove yourself from the situation, set a timer to allow your partner an agreed upon amount of time to vent, and/or when they are ready, you can problem solve together.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Or, maybe you need to make a plan to do some things on your own you haven’t been able to do because your partner’s anxiety.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Anxious Partner</b></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The more your partner pushes you to calm down, the more anxious you feel, and the more you want to do something else to make the anxiety go away. </span><span class=\"s1\">Tips to change these situations:</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">1. SHARE YOUR FEELINGS</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If this isn’t a core issue you’re working on in this program, share with your partner how it feels to be anxious. Give him/her a chance to empathize with you. Oftentimes, anxiety is hidden until it explodes. Be aware of how you are feeling and let your partner in. Letting your partner know, especially when they are doing something that contributes to your anxiety, is important. He/she may be totally unaware of what he/she is doing! </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">2. WHAT HELPS?</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Try to tell your partner what you need. For example, maybe you want your partner to comfort and support you rather than try to fix what’s wrong or tell you to calm down. Learning to regulate anxiety on your own is important, but so is letting your partner know what makes it worse. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">3. SEEK OUT HELP</span></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Would advice from a therapist or physician be an option for you? There are many effective therapies and medications shown to help people struggling with anxiety. Additionally, self-help books or other online programs like this one, but specifically for anxiety may be an option for you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Is a partner from a previous relationship interfering or causing problems in your current relationship? An ex-partner can be a huge external stress on your current relationship. If so, this post will help you identify common problems around exes and get some ideas on how to solve them.</p>\n<h2><strong>Issues Around Ex-partners Can Have Many Forms</strong></h2>\n<p>After a romantic relationship ends, sometimes ex-partners continue to be involved in our lives.  The most common reason is shared custody of children, but problems can also be caused by continued contact with the ex or relationships with shared friends or family members of the ex-partner.  If you’re in this situation, it is likely difficult for you and your partner to agree on boundaries regarding the exes and agree to how much input and/or presence they have in your relationship.  Couples dealing with ex-partners tend to experience one of two common cycles: &#8220;The Ex Drives a Wedge Between Us&#8221; and &#8220;The Ex is a Source of Stress for Both of Us&#8221;</p>\n<h2>THE EX DRIVES A WEDGE BETWEEN US</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, it can be hard to balance the needs / desires of the Ex with the needs / desires of the current relationship. When that happens, it may create fights in the current relationship.</p>\n<h3>The Partner with an Ex</h3>\n<p>You may feel caught between your current partner and your ex. Conflicting opinions or agendas may cause you stress and leave you feeling like you can’t win. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>1. MAKE A PLAN</h4>\n<p>When an ex is causing arguments between you and your partner, the most important thing you can do is make sure you and your partner are on the same page BEFORE the ex is there. So, sit down now with your partner and make a plan for how the two of you will handle the situation.</p>\n<h4>2. SHARE WITH YOUR PARTNER</h4>\n<p>When you talk about this with your partner, be sure to reveal any hidden emotions you have (especially if this isn’t the core issue you’ve been working on). Nothing can help repair the damage your ex has done like opening up to your partner and letting your partner know that this situation bothers you as well.</p>\n<h4>3. KEEP YOUR PARTNER IN THE LOOP</h4>\n<p>Your partner won’t always be there when you talk with your ex. And your partner will be worried about what happens when he/she isn’t there. So, be up front with your partner about when you’ve said to your ex and what you discussed so it doesn’t feel like you’re hiding something or lying. And don’t fall in to the trap of trying to “protect” your partner by not telling her bad things that happened. If your partner later finds out (and you didn’t tell your partner), that will seriously undermine your partner’s trust in you.</p>\n<h4>4. SET BOUNDARIES</h4>\n<p>Be clear about where the boundaries are with your ex. Certain topics are sacred to your current relationship while others are shared with your ex (like children from the previous relationship). If you find your ex putting his/her nose where it doesn’t belong, politely ask that he/she respect your privacy and the relationship you have with your partner.</p>\n<h3>The Other Partner</h3>\n<p>When your partner is still in contact with his/her ex, you may feel neglected or like you don’t matter as much as your partner’s ex. It might seem that your partner is choosing his/her ex over you, which is very hurtful. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>1. MAKE A PLAN</h4>\n<p>When an ex is causing arguments between you and your partner, the most important thing you can do is make sure you and your partner are on the same page BEFORE the ex is there. So, sit down now with your partner and make a plan for how the two of you will handle the situation. Remember to include in the plan: a) what you will both do – and won’t do – in front of the ex; b) how you both will handle it after the ex leaves.</p>\n<h4>2. CHECK IN</h4>\n<p>Sometimes your partner will forget to keep you in the loop about what is happening with his/her ex. Try to find a non-blaming and non-accusatory way to check in with your partner about his/her ex. Maybe you could check in once a week about any decisions your partner made with his/her ex so you feel in the loop? (If you’re going to do this, this would be a good thing to put in the plan you two develop.)</p>\n<h4>3. OFFER HELP</h4>\n<p>Ask your partner what it is that you can do or change to be helpful, and remember that your support is a huge help to him/her. By asking how you can be involved, your partner will be less likely to feel like you are intruding and you may end up with more input into the situation.</p>\n<h4>4. ASK FOR WHAT YOU NEED</h4>\n<p>Try to express to your partner what you need. Maybe you need more clear communication about when he/she has seen the ex and/or has responsibility for the kids. Or maybe you need some time set aside just for the two of you to spend together. If there are specific topics that you think should be off limits with the ex (like your intimate life) or certain situations that are difficult for you (like spending time with shared friends), let your partner know how he/she can help you navigate those events.</p>\n<h2>THE EX IS A SOURCE OF STRESS FOR BOTH OF US</h2>\n<p>When an ex-partner has a forceful personality or strong opinions – even when both of you in the current relationship are on the same page &#8211; it can be difficult to set effective boundaries.</p>\n<h3>The Partner with an Ex</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, you might get really frustrated with your ex and want your partner to help. But your partner might not step in as much as you’d like. If that’s the case, consider the following tips:</p>\n<h4>1. DISCUSS BOUNDARIES</h4>\n<p>Have a conversation with your partner to decide where and how you are both comfortable with the ex being involved. Once you have a clear list, share this with your ex. Although it might be difficult at first, when expectations are clear people are better able to work together around a shared goal, like parenting the children.</p>\n<h4>2. BE ASSERTIVE</h4>\n<p>There is a difference between being assertive and being bossy, and a big difference between being assertive and being passive (e.g. not directly stating what you want but rather dropping hints). When you are assertive about what you expect from both your partner and your ex, you tell them clearly (in a non-blaming way) how you would like each of them to act. Be willing to hear their sides and compromise, but speaking up is the first step!</p>\n<h4>3. TURN TO YOUR PARTNER</h4>\n<p>Especially if this isn’t the core issue you decided to work on, turn to your partner when you are feeling frustrated with your ex. Opening up and sharing the hidden emotions (fear, frustration, helplessness) can start a great conversation. When you and your partner are on the same page and a team together, you will be better equipped to talk with your ex.</p>\n<h3>The Other Partner</h3>\n<p>When your partner is still in contact with his/her ex, especially when dealing with shared custody, you may feel pulled into their relationship as well, even if it doesn’t feel like your place or this isn’t something you should be doing. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>1. THIS IS HARD FOR ME</h4>\n<p>Sometimes, particular situations are more difficult as an outside partner or as a step-parent. For example, if trading the kids with your partner’s ex is particularly uncomfortable for you, ask your partner if they can handle this without you. Sometimes, staying away from situations that will cause unnecessary fights is the best move you can make.</p>\n<h4>2. KNOW YOUR ROLE</h4>\n<p>When you are a step-parent or part of a blended family, it can be difficult to navigate your relationship both with the children and with their biological parent who isn’t your partner. If you haven’t already or this isn’t your core issue, have a conversation with your partner and his/her ex about your role in the children’s lives. Everyone’s first goal should be providing a healthy and happy home for the kids!</p>\n<h4>3. SUPPORT YOUR PARTNER</h4>\n<p>If you are unhappy with the relationship you and/or your partner has with his/her ex, then this has likely caused fights in the past. Be as supportive of your partner as you can. Offer to help and see what they ask for, be willing to compromise, and make sure your partner knows you are there for him/her and on his/her team.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<h2>Why Intimate Relationships Are Important</h2>\n<p>You’ve probably heard the phrase, “survival of the fittest” before. We live in a world that can feel like one big competition. Whether you’re competing for a spot on a sports team, at your dream school, or for your dream job, you may find yourself facing emotional, physical, mental, and even spiritual challenges. However, many studies prove that if you are in an intimate relationship, those challenges will be easier to face with the support of an intimate partner.</p>\n<p>For example, one study used an MRI to observe how 16 women with and without intimate partners reacted to perceived threats. They were told that if they saw a red X, there was a chance of receiving a small shock to the ankle. If they saw a blue O, there was no chance of receiving a shock. The participants were placed under three separate conditions looking at either red X’s or blue O’s. First, holding the hand of someone they were in an intimate relationship with, while being shown an X or O. The second, while holding the hand of a stranger of the same sex as their partner, while being shown an X or O. The third, not holding anyone’s hand, while being shown an X or O. Once the images of certain brain regions such as the right anterior insula, which responds to perceived threat, were analyzed, it was found that when the women were holding their partner’s hand, their brains were less activated when shown a red X than when holding a stranger’s hand, or no hand at all. It was also found that the happier the women reported they were with their intimate relationships, the less the threat-related regions of their brains activated when they were shown a red X.</p>\n<p>Another study observed 188 couples to determine how being in an intimate relationship affected how one partner coped with having congestive heart failure. The research assistants gave standardized questionnaires and interviewed each partner separately. Then, the couples were videotaped talking about something they disagreed on in their intimate relationship. The tapes were analyzed to differentiate the ratio of positive to negative things the partners said to each other. That data made an index of overall relationship quality which broke down the level of intimacy in each relationship. Researchers then followed public records to determine which patients died over the next 4 years. The study found that the happier the couples were with the intimacy in their relationship, according to the data index, the less likely the partner with congestive heart failure was to die in the 4-year period. How we talk to our intimate partners and how happy we are with our intimate relationships is correlated with our life expectancy, especially with a health problem.</p>\n<h2>Intimate Relationships are Essential to the Human Experience</h2>\n<p>Intimate relationships are a basic feature of who we are as human beings. We all have a nervous system that responds to and equips us not only for intimate social interaction, but to love and be loved. We are biologically attuned to the person we share an intimate bond with. Just like our capacity for language and logic, our capacity for intimacy is a big factor in how we regulate our emotions, how well we understand our partner’s emotions and our emotional intelligence which allows us to not only survive, but thrive in the world we live in. In order to understand the positive and negative aspects of being human, we must work to understand not only birth and death, but conflicts, emotions and intimate relationships.</p>\n<h3><strong>Three Intrinsic Properties of Intimate Relationships:</strong></h3>\n<p>1. They determine the survival of our species<br />\n2. They are a universal human experience<br />\n3. They expand our range of emotional experience</p>\n<h3><strong>Three Extrinsic Properties of Intimate Relationships:</strong></h3>\n<p>1. Intimate relationships affect our mental and physical health<br />\n2. They influence the well-being of children<br />\n3. They form the fabric of society</p>\n<h2>Intimate Relationships Determine the Survival of Our Species</h2>\n<p>The phrase “survival of the fittest” comes from the idea of natural selection in Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution. According to this theory, sometimes random gene changes result in better fitness. Fitness is the chance that offspring will survive and reproduce. Different factors such as intimate relationships determine whether or not a gene or set of genes will improve fitness. The saying “it takes a tribe” is supported by scientific evidence.</p>\n<p>Social interactions, alliances, coalitions, and hierarchies are critical. They can have serious consequences on how successful a family is at surviving and reproducing. The ways we humans attract and select intimate partners, the attachments we make, how willing we are to reproduce, how often we do, and how well we provide for and take care of each other and our children directly and indirectly affect fitness. Interpersonal, and more specifically, intimate relationships play a key role in not only how long we live, but in the quality of the lives we live.</p>\n<h2>The Biology Behind Fairy Tales and Fantasies</h2>\n<p>Magical, is often how we describe an intimate sexual encounter that matches and maybe exceeds what we perceive to be ideal. However, there is biology behind the fairy tales and fantasies. Sexual desires and interactions are the result of a mix of neurochemical events which link physical and psychological reactions to spinal reflexes that arouse the limbic system and sensory cortex, which causes the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland to produce hormones that alter the sensitivity and functioning of our sexual organs.</p>\n<p>MRI scans prove that being in a happy and healthy intimate relationship helps us get through life. They also prove that love is biologically based. They show that our brains react differently when we see a picture of the person we love and are in an intimate relationship with, than when we see a picture of someone we have a close relationship with, or when we see a picture of a stranger.</p>\n<p>MRI scans of participants in a study looking at their intimate partner revealed that the regions of our brain, like the anterior cingulate cortex, medial insula, caudate, and the putamen, which are stimulated when we receive money, and even an intravenous injection of cocaine are also stimulated by the sight of our intimate partners.</p>\n<p>These responses motivate us towards closeness with our intimate partners just as they motivate us to make money. On the other hand, deactivation in these same regions of our brain occur when we are sad, depressed, or receiving critical social judgments.</p>\n<h2>What’s Love Got to Do with It?</h2>\n<p>Sexual desire and romantic love with an intimate partner seem to function as two different biological systems. They both cause the release of an endorphin called oxytocin during intimate physical contact such as a massage or sexual intercourse. Oxytocin serves as a key ingredient in the neurobiological system that promotes feelings of calmness, sociability, and trust. Part of why this happens is, oxytocin reduces activity in fear-related brain structures such as the amygdala and hypothalamus.</p>\n<p>Oxytocin is partly why holding the hand of our intimate partner while facing a perceived threat helps us cope with it, causing our threat-related brain regions to activate less than they would if we faced the perceived threat alone. Biological systems in our bodies respond in systematic ways to what is happening in our intimate relationships.</p>\n<h2>Intimate Relationships are a Universal Human Experience</h2>\n<p>Lasting intimate relationships, often formed with the intention of having children, are found in all societies. One study on 100 industrial and agricultural countries found that more than 90% of all men and women have experienced a type of intimate relationship, like marriage, by the time they are in their late 40’s. Some of these intimate relationships are legally sanctioned like marriages, while others are not.</p>\n<p>One type of intimate relationship that is not legally sanctioned is cohabitation, where intimate partners live together but are not married. Both of these intimate relationships usually involve two people who have an emotional investment in one another. These types of intimate relationships are often motivated by romantic intimacy, or love, and mutual attraction. Stories about intimacy, some fiction, some non-fiction, are passed down generation to generation all over the world. Clear evidence derived from studies of ethnography, neuroscience, folk tales, and even ethology supports romantic love’s universality.</p>\n<p>The need to belong is a fundamental source of motivation for human behavior and this need is commonly met through intimate relationships by stable bonds, frequent contact, and mutual concern. Just because we are designed to love and be loved does not mean that everyone has the same capacity for it.</p>\n<h2>Historical and Cultural Shifts in Intimate Relationships</h2>\n<p>Historical and cultural factors affect how we give and receive intimacy. For example, two intimate partners struggling to make ends meet will have different core issues than two intimate partners that have a high socioeconomic status. The way various cultures frame what intimacy looks like is demonstrated in how love songs vary from one culture to another.</p>\n<p>Young adults in North America and China self-reported very similarly when interviewed on emotions they felt during common experiences, except when it came to love. Young adults in North America framed love as intensely positive and a big contributor to happiness while young adults in China framed love as often being one sided and a big contributor to sadness. Perhaps this is because North America is individualistic and focuses on an individual’s goals over the goals of a group while China does the opposite. The point is, how intimacy is initiated, maintained, and experienced depends on many factors which vary across cultures.</p>\n<h3>Individualistic Intimacy vs Collectivist Intimacy</h3>\n<p>In individualistic cultures, family is not involved in how an intimate partner is selected but it does support the process of finding an intimate partner and gets introduced to the intimate partner by the individual. In collectivist cultures, family often chooses the intimate partner with the goal of improving the family’s financial stability and or social status. Once the family finds a mate they approve of, they introduce the intimate partner to the individual.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Western values have spread. Now, many intimate relationships in collectivist cultures are started by individuals, and not their families. Marriages used to primarily be a type of business transaction between two families, now, marriage is about two individuals who want to move the commitment of their intimate relationship to the next level and centered around intimacy. Intimate relationships have a core structure of emotional and sexual interdependence that is relatable. The differences are because of cultural settings and historical periods. Intimacy is a universal human experience, but not every human experiences it the same way universally.</p>\n<h3>Intimacy Has Changed</h3>\n<p>• Industrialization and bigger cities decreased the demand for extra hands around the house. People stopped having as many kids as they used to.<br />\n• Increased Graphic Mobility decreased the influence parents have on kids.<br />\n• Improved opportunities for Women giving them even more control over who they had intimate relationships and why, regardless of family ties.<br />\n• It’s easier to get a Divorce. More people marry simply because of an intimate relationship that is bringing them personal satisfaction. It is easier to leave a marriage that is not producing the happiness it was expected to, or that it used to, which makes marriage more fragile.<br />\n• Cohabitation is increasing, and the number of people getting married is decreasing.<br />\nContrary to popular belief, cohabitation does not often lead to marriage. Marriage is no longer seen as a prerequisite to having kids.</p>\n<h2>Intimate Relationships Expand Our Range of Emotional Experience</h2>\n<p>The quest for intimacy is often seen the same thing as a quest for love. However, not every intimate relationship has love. Intimacy and love are not synonyms. Love can be found in various relationships that are not intimate such as friendships and parent-child relationships. Intimate relationships are fundamentally emotional because of how diverse and sexually charged they are.</p>\n<p>Emotional experiences are what we look for when we start an intimate relationship, affect us most during one, and what we reflect on once the intimate relationship ends. Love is not easily defined, but it has essential attributes. Different types of love result from different combinations of these attributes, and a lack of certain attributes.</p>\n<h3>The Seven Essential Attributes of Love</h3>\n<p>1. Desire: wanting to be united with a partner, physically and emotionally.<br />\n2. Idealization: Believing the partner is unique and special.<br />\n3. Joy: experiencing strong, positive emotions.<br />\n4. Preoccupation: thinking a lot about the partner and having little control over when.<br />\n5. Proximity: working to maintain or restore physical closeness or emotional contact.<br />\n6. Prioritizing: giving the relationship more importance than other interests and responsibilities.<br />\n7. Caring: experiencing and expressing feelings of empathy and compassion for the partner.</p>\n<h3>Different Types of Love</h3>\n<p>There are two main types of love that pull us into intimate relationships. Use the checklist below to understand the love in your intimate relationship more.</p>\n<p>1. The type of love that comes to mind when people think of intimacy is passionate love. Passionate love is recognized by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Infatuation</li>\n<li>Intense preoccupation with the partner</li>\n<li>Strong sexual longing</li>\n<li>Throes of ecstasy</li>\n<li>Feelings of exhilaration that come from being reunited with an intimate partner</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2. Compassionate love is recognized by similar feelings, but they’re less intense. They’re also enriched by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warm feelings of attachment</li>\n<li>An authentic and enduring bond</li>\n<li>A sense of mutual commitment</li>\n<li>The profound knowledge that you are caring for another person who is in turn caring for you</li>\n<li>Feeling proud of a mate’s accomplishments</li>\n<li>Satisfaction that comes from sharing goals and perspectives intimately</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Intimate Relationships Affect Our Mental and Physical Health</h2>\n<p>Intimate relationships affect how happy we generally are in life; they affect our subjective well-being. Married people report greater happiness than unmarried people who live together, and unmarried people who live together are happier than people who are divorced, separated, or widowed. This shows that relationship status is related to subjective well-being. The perceived quality of a relationship will affect happiness too. For example, a single person without an intimate relationship will be happier than a person in an unhappy intimate relationship.</p>\n<p>Satisfaction with an intimate relationship is a better indicator of subjective well-being than satisfaction with anything else including but not limited to work, money, friends, and health. Getting into or out of an intimate relationship, relationship transitions, is also linked to subjective well-being. When people get married their subjective well-being increases but as they divorce their subjective well-being decreases, and it remains pretty low for the following years.</p>\n<p>Sometimes when challenges arise in intimacy, people lean on substance abuse which often creates health challenges which can make it harder to improve intimacy. Experiments can’t be conducted to prove this as it wouldn’t be ethical. However, the best available evidence shows something about the experience of being married itself has protective benefits. Something about marriage seems to give people a type of protection that is not truly available in cohabiting or single people. People who are in happy, healthy, intimate relationships have more money, more sex, better health, and are happier with their lives.</p>\n<p>There’s an old joke, “What do married and single people have in common?”<br />\n“Each thinks the other is having more sex.”</p>\n<p>It turns out, the single people are right, married people have more sex than people who are cohabiting but not married. No one is sure if the chicken or the egg came first, and we are also not sure if general happiness with intimacy or a good sex life comes first, but clearly, there is an undeniable correlation. Happiness with intimacy does not just help people live longer after a heart attack, it decreases the chance of catching a cold after being exposed to an experimentally administered virus. It takes women in distressed relationships longer to recover from breast cancer, the list goes on. Cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune functioning are all affected by levels of conflict and hostility in intimate relationships. Conflict reduces the number of cytokines in the body, which respond to various health treats.</p>\n<h2>Intimate Relationships Influence the Well-being of Children</h2>\n<p>Babies are cute, cuddly and enter the world with endless potential but are helpless at first. They’re extremely vulnerable, and as a result, dependent. They depend on caregivers for food, shelter, safety, stimulation, and affection. Just as relationship status, relationship quality, and relationship transitions relate to the subjective well-being of people in an intimate relationship, they relate to the well-being of children. In fact, the relationship status of parents is more influential than their race and their education in determining whether their children will experience severe poverty.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nationally representative data in the U.S shows that 81% of children with unmarried parents experience severe poverty, compared with 69% of black children and 63% of children whose head of household had completed less than 12 years of school.</li>\n<li>Compared to biological children of married parents, biological children of cohabiting parents are less engaged in schoolwork and display more emotional and behavioral problems.</li>\n<li>The quality of the intimate relationship parents have is related to children’s emotional security. When there is conflict between parents, children commonly turn to acting out and aggression with their classmates.</li>\n<li>Parental conflict affects a range of biological systems in developing children, compromising their health by reducing their sleep and causing puberty to start earlier.</li>\n<li>Contrary to popular belief, a divorce itself does not negatively affect children as much as the number of relationship transitions do. If the parents’ marriage was full of conflict before the divorce, children can benefit from the divorce.</li>\n<li>The family circumstances children encounter influence how they will manage their own intimate relationships, how much education they will complete, and their parenting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Intimate Relationships Form the Fabric of Society</h2>\n<p>It may be hard to see how our intimate relationships affect anyone outside of our social circles, we may try to keep our intimate relationships private. However, social control theory explains the connection between intimate relationships and the broader social impact of individual’s actions. Petty crime, alcohol, marijuana, and other drug use like cocaine is known to fluctuate with changes in relationship status.</p>\n<p>Factors such as intelligence, personality, poverty, and even parental crime do not explain findings on how likely men are to reduce or stop crime as happy marriages with quality intimacy do. Interdependence in high-quality intimate relationships can encourage partners to guide each other toward socially acceptable lifestyles.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, intimacy ironically is a blessing and a curse. Much of what allows us to enjoy passion and companionship also leave us vulnerable to pain and suffering. Intimacy or the lack thereof brings out the best and worst in us. Love and hate can affect not only our emotional health, but our mental, spiritual, and physical health too. Intimate relationships give the time between dawn and dusk meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<h2>Intimate Relationships Take Work</h2>\n<p>Congratulations on taking initiative and working to improve your intimate relationship. It’s not easy, intimate relationships are complicated. Even Albert Einstein, who solved great mysteries, developed theories such as the theory of relativity, and is commonly known as one of the most intelligent individuals to have lived, had trouble with his interpersonal relationships. He admitted to failing at being a husband with his first and second wife, and to having an extremely difficult time being a father. Einstein’s eldest son once said, “Probably the only project he ever gave up on was me.” Some of Einstein’s conditions for his first wife were for her to not expect intimacy from him, stop talking to him if he requested, and to immediately leave his bedroom or study at his request. Don’t feel crushed by how tough the challenges in your relationship may feel, instead, focus on what you can do to help improve the intimacy in your relationship.</p>\n<h2>Interdependence is Key</h2>\n<p>Intimate relationships involve the personalities, feelings, passions, and goals of two people. As a result, intimate relationships are challenging, but desirable and enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Take a moment to ask yourself if your relationship meets the four criteria which define an intimate relationship:</p>\n<p><em><strong>1. Bidirectional interdependence</strong></em><br />\nDo you rely on each other?</p>\n<p><em><strong>2. Considering each other special and unique</strong></em><br />\nDo you think you could easily replace your partner?<br />\nWhat makes them special?<br />\nDo they make you feel replaceable?<br />\nWhat does your partner think makes you special?</p>\n<p><em><strong>3. Influence each other across a variety of domains</strong></em><br />\nDo you consider your partner when making a decision?<br />\nDoes your partner consider you when making a decision?</p>\n<p><em><strong>4. Experience some degree of mutual sexual passion</strong></em><br />\nHow often do you want to be physically intimate with your partner?<br />\nHow often does your partner want to be physically intimate with you?<br />\nAre you both happy with your sex life?</p>\n<p>It’s shared experiences and continuous interactions that keep people from being strangers even after they haven’t seen each other in a while. The closeness of a relationship is demonstrated in how strong and frequent the various influences partners have over each other are.</p>\n<h2>Turning Impersonal Relationships into Personal Relationships</h2>\n<p>Interdependence is key, but not the only key ingredient for a personal relationship. There is interdependence between a teacher and a student, a company manager and an employee, a doctor, and a patient. You cannot have intimacy without interdependence but just because you have an interdependent relationship does not mean you have an intimate relationship. Two individuals looking to turn their impersonal relationship more personal need more than interdependence. Impersonal relationships are task-oriented and tend to be formal. Personal relationships tend to be informal and allow for deeper emotional connections. In order for an impersonal relationship to become a personal relationship, it requires interdependence and mutual admiration between two people. Two people that identify and like the unique qualities in each other and do not believe they can easily replace each other. Often the value we place in a relationship can be measured by how we would be affected and how we would react to losing that person. Losing a parent is different than losing an acquaintance.</p>\n<h2>Personal Relationships versus Close Relationships</h2>\n<p>The words personal and close are similar but not all personal relationships are close. Some relationships that are interdependent, and people treat each other as unique, irreplaceable individuals, but how close they are varies. For example, the relationship between an aunt and a niece is different than the relationship between a boyfriend and girlfriend.</p>\n<h2>Close Relationships versus Intimate Relationships</h2>\n<p>Closeness is crucial, but not the final ingredient missing from the ingredients we’ve discussed will cook up an intimate relationship. Compare and contrast your intimate relationship with your relationship with family members, friends, and coworkers. If you would like, you can make a list and reflect on what those similarities and differences are between those relationships.</p>\n<h2>One-Night Stands</h2>\n<p>Having sex outside of close relationships, having hookups without strong and frequent interdependence does not make the cut for an intimate relationship. Just because two people are physically intimate does not mean that they have an intimate relationship. However, the possibility for a close relationship resulting in physical intimacy does take a close relationship to the next level, it makes it intimate. Even unhappy couples with strong interdependence that may result in physical intimacy are considered to be in an intimate relationship even though it is not a happy one. An unhappy relationship is different than a happy relationship, but both are considered intimate relationships.</p>\n<h2>The Next Level</h2>\n<p>Taking a close relationship to the next level doesn’t necessarily mean that specific close relationship will become romantically intimate. Both best friends and significant others hold a closer place to our hearts than other relationships with less intimacy. However, remember that the relationship also needs to be set apart according to how interdependent it is, and how frequent various interactions happen between the two.</p>\n<p>Take a moment and reflect on the differences between your close friends, best friends, family friends, family members, and intimate partners. Think about the differences in your view of each relationship and how for example, having a conflict with a close friend affects you differently than having a conflict with an intimate partner does.</p>\n<p>An easily distinguishable difference between any close relationship and an intimate relationship is whether or not both partners feel sexual tension. That’s an easy way to evaluate if a close relationship has been taken to the next level, that it has become more intimate than other close relationships. Regardless of whether or not any “moves” will be made, the potential to engage in sexual intercourse exists in the minds of both people involved. Once a lustful, sexual, passionate vibe is present and the possibility of having sex exists, a close relationship becomes an intimate relationship.</p>\n<h2>Intimacy Check</h2>\n<p>A simplified way to determine if you have an intimate relationship with your partner is to ask yourself if the following is true about you and your partner:</p>\n<p>1. Do your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors frequently affect each other?<br />\n2. Are you both happy with how frequently you see each other?<br />\n3. Do you both text each other when you don’t see each other as often as you would both like to?<br />\n4. Do you enjoy activities such as studying, cuddling, eating, or going out together?<br />\n5. Do you feel sad when your partner feels sad? Do they feel sad when you feel sad?<br />\n6. Do you feel happy when your partner feels happy? Does your partner feel happy when you feel happy?<br />\n7. Is physical intimacy a possibility in your relationship?</p>\n<h2>Relationship Category Breakdown</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>An interdependent relationship is one where the behavior of one partner affects the other.</li>\n<li>A personal relationship is one where partners consider each other to be irreplaceable.</li>\n<li>A close relationship is one where partners have a strong and frequent influence on each other.</li>\n<li>An intimate relationship is one where mutual sexual tension exists, and partners may share and express sexual feelings for each other, possibly resulting in physical intimacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Do you and your partner have difficulties because one or both of you feel emotionally unsupported? Or do one of you struggle with “being there” for your partner when he/she is upset or feeling down? If so, this activity should help.</p>\n<p>People differ in how they want to be supported and problems arise when one partner does not meet the needs or expectations of the other. For example, a partner more in tune with feelings may share emotions when looking for support; however, if the other partner is not as emotional, he/she may respond in a way that feels unsupported, invalidated, or dismissed. These issues often create the following cycles: &#8220;I Am Not Overreacting!&#8221; and &#8220;I Need You to Listen, Not Fix it!&#8221;</p>\n<h2><u>I AM NOT OVERREACTING</u></h2>\n<p>In this cycle, partners may differ on emotional expressiveness, reactivity, or sensitivity. One partner may feel unsupported when he/she seeks emotional support and the other partner responds in a way that feels invalidating such as by saying, “oh, that’s not a big deal” or by refusing to talk to the partner until he/she “calms down”. This can cause a lot of hurt, sadness, and resentment.<br />\nThe partner who is less emotionally reactive or expressive may not understand why his/her partner is upset and may feel attacked when his/her partner accuses him/her of not caring. However, he/she may not understand why something is a big deal and may feel he/she is helping when he/she tells the partner to “relax”. This can often lead to frustration and both partners feeling misunderstood.</p>\n<h2><em>The Partner Who Feels Emotionally Unsupported</em></h2>\n<p>Although you used to turn to your partner for emotional support, over time you’ve learned that your partner likely won’t be there for you in the way you want. As a result, you may get very upset when your partner doesn’t support you, react with surface emotions such as anger or frustration, or eventually open up less to your partner. Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<h3>1. REMEMBER NATURAL DIFFERENCES</h3>\n<p>Remember your DEEP Understanding and consider how each of the DEEP components could be contributing to both your and your partner’s feelings. You and your partner likely have natural differences in emotionally expressiveness and/or sensitivity. Remember, your partner isn’t trying to be unsupportive. When your partner does not respond in the way you need, try not to respond with anger, frustration, or other surface emotions that could make your partner react. Instead, talk with your partner and give him/her some tips on how he/she could respond in ways that would make you feel more supported.</p>\n<h3>2 STRENGTHEN YOUR RELATIONSHIP</h3>\n<p>Because you feel unsupported, you likely also feel disconnected from your partner. Therefore, one suggestion is to increase intimacy in other domains. For example, if you both are comfortable with touch, consider cuddling, hugs, or even sex as a way to feel more connected. Other suggestions include prioritizing date nights or planning to do something fun together at least once a week such as doing a physical activity, cooking together, playing a game, or watching TV.</p>\n<h3>3. OTHER TYPES OF SUPPORT</h3>\n<p>Try to recognize the ways your partner does support you (e.g., financially, helping around the house, supportive of career or school, etc.) By not dismissing these other types of support as valid, you are more likely to be less biased in how you view your partner and are more likely to feel supported, even if your partner is not as sensitive or emotional.</p>\n<h3>4. CAN SOMEONE ELSE PROVIDE SUPPORT?</h3>\n<p>While you certainly don’t want to shut your partner out and not share any of your feelings, it may be that a friend or family member is going to be more naturally supportive. If you know that your partner “just doesn’t get” why you’re upset about a particular topic, consider talking with someone else instead. In this case, acceptance of natural differences may be your best solution.</p>\n<h2><em>The Partner Who is Told He/She is Emotionally Unsupportive</em></h2>\n<p>After hearing over and over how insensitive or unsupportive you are, you may feel frustrated and hurt. You may also feel stuck because you don’t know how to make things better or like you are being punished for not being as emotional. These feelings may make you pull away from your partner or respond very defensively. Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<h3>1. BE A GOOD LISTENER</h3>\n<p>Being a supportive and validating partner starts with being a good listener. Often, your partner just wants to share what he/she is feeling with you. So, when your partner tells you something, do not just respond with opinions, judgments, or requests to calm down. Give him or her the time to express feelings. Also, use body language to show that you are listening. It is important that you make eye contact, turn your body towards them, and stop whatever you are doing.</p>\n<h3>2 THE KEY TO LISTENING</h3>\n<p>You can recognize your partner’s feelings as valid without agreeing with him/her. Therefore, do not respond with statements that undermine your partner’s feelings like “It’s not a big deal” or “You’re overreacting”. Instead, summarize his/her feelings to show understanding. Try to say things like, “I can tell you’re feeling really upset, frustrated, hurt, etc.” or “It sounds like that situation was really hard for you.” Remember, your partner is entitled to his/her feelings just as you are. By responding in a way that summarizes your partner’s feelings, your partner will feel heard and supported.</p>\n<h3>3. ASK WHAT YOUR PARTNER NEEDS</h3>\n<p>At a time when your partner is NOT upset, have a conversation about what you could do when he/she is upset that would feel good to your partner. Your partner might have some very simple ideas that would help.</p>\n<h2><u>I NEED YOU TO LISTEN, NOT FIX IT</u></h2>\n<p>Here, one partner may feel unheard and unsupported when he/she seeks support and the other partner starts problem solving or tries to “fix it” instead of listening. This can cause feelings of invalidation, hurt, sadness, and loneliness.The partner whose first instinct to try to help their partner solve the problem may feel annoyed or frustrated because it may feel like the partner “must enjoy being upset” if the partner doesn’t want to fix the problem. So, while he/she initially felt the desire to help the partner, he/she eventually tunes out the partner because he/she feels powerless to change the partner’s situation.</p>\n<h2><em>The Expressive Partner </em></h2>\n<p>You may feel hurt or frustrated when you are turning to your partner for emotional support and he/she responds with problem solving. This can leave you feeling like he/she doesn’t care for your needs. Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<h3>1. EXPECTATIONS</h3>\n<p>Are there any ways in which your partner does provide support? Are there sometimes when your partner’s problem solving is helpful? This is an important question because when you are upset about something, you are more likely to focus on what your partner is NOT doing to your satisfaction instead of focusing on when his/her response to “fix it” is helpful. By asking yourself this question every day, you’re more likely to notice and appreciate when your partner is meeting your needs. If you&#8217;re still feel you need more support, use the problem solving activity in the 4th phase to identify other ways he/she can provide the support you need.</p>\n<h3>2. SPEAKER SKILLS APPLY</h3>\n<p>Whenever you share your frustrations with your partner or ask him/her for more help, remember your Speaker Skills. Make sure to watch your tone of voice and not use blaming language. As much as you want him/her to respond to your emotional needs in a certain way, communicating often in a more demanding way will likely result in him/her pulling away and you not getting your desired outcome.</p>\n<h3>3. TELL PARTNER WHAT YOU WANT</h3>\n<p>If you know your partner has a tendency to jump right into problem solving, start the conversation saying something like “I’m really upset and I just need you to listen to me for a few minutes, okay?” That can help your partner get into the right mindset.</p>\n<h3>4. USE THE SPEAKER/LISTENER STRUCTURE</h3>\n<p>While you certainly don’t want to use it for every conversation, if you’ve repeatedly tried to talk with your partner about a particular topic and he/she just doesn’t listen, consider using the speaker/listener structure. In fact, we have an activity in the Strengthen phase of this program that will allow you to have a speaker/listener conversation about anything you want.</p>\n<h2><em>The Problem Solving Partner</em></h2>\n<p>If your partner reacts negatively to your problem solving, you may feel frustrated because your partner does not recognize you are trying to help. Additionally, you may not know how to provide support in the way your partner wants which leaves you feeling sad and/or annoyed. Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<h3>1. ACTIVE LISTENING</h3>\n<p>It may come more naturally for you to jump into problem solving when your partner expresses him/herself, but that can often feel invalidating to your partner when he/she just wants you to listen. Show you are listening by asking questions.</p>\n<h3>2. REMEMBER YOUR LISTENER TIPS</h3>\n<p>Practice how to be a good listener: a) summarize; b) don’t defend or justify; and c) don’t jump in right away. Try practicing these skills in addition to not telling your partner what to do.</p>\n<h3>3. ASK HOW YOU CAN BE HELPFUL</h3>\n<p>If you are unsure if your partner wants advice, ask “are you coming to me for advice or do you want me to listen?” The fact you are asking your partner for his/her needs will help him/her feel supported.</p>\n<h3>4. NATURAL DIFFERENCES</h3>\n<p>Remember your DEEP Understanding and consider how each of the DEEP components could be contributing to both your and your partner’s feelings. You and your partner likely have natural differences in emotionally expressiveness.

    "title": {
      "rendered": "Does Your Partner Not Trust You?"
    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>If you and your partner are struggling with trust, it can be upsetting and difficult. When one partner suspects the other partner can’t trust him/her, there are two main situations: &#8220;I Didn’t Do Anything!&#8221; or &#8220;I’m Hiding Something&#8221;.</p>\n<h2>I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING!</h2>\n<p>If your partner doesn’t trust you and you haven’t given him/her any reason to feel that way, it can make you feel frustrated and exhausted by an uphill battle you didn’t start. If so, consider the following tips:</p>\n<h3>1. SHARE MORE WITH YOUR PARTNER</h3>\n<p>Even if you haven’t done something objectively wrong, if your partner doesn’t feel like they can trust you this will degrade the relationship. Sometimes this comes from different levels of comfort with sharing. If you wouldn’t normally talk about issues related to your partner’s suspicions but wouldn’t mind sharing, giving your partner more information might be helpful. For example, if your partner is worried you’re cheating on him/her, sharing more about who you saw during the day or where you went would be helpful. If your partner feels in the loop, he/she is less likely to be caught off guard and feel mistrustful.</p>\n<h3>2. CONSIDER HIDDEN EMOTIONS AND PAST EXPERIENCES</h3>\n<p>While what you see (your partner’s hidden emotion) is likely anger or constant questioning, the likely hidden emotion is fear – of you ending the relationship, of being taken advantage of, or of something bad happening. And these hidden emotions are often caused by previous experiences. For example, was your partner cheated on in the past or did he/she grow up in a household where there weren’t any stable relationships? If you haven’t talked about these issues, try using the speaker/listener activity in the Strengthen phase to get your partner to open up. The more you know, the more accepting you’ll likely be of your partner’s behavior.</p>\n<h3>3. ARE YOU WILLING TO BE TESTED?</h3>\n<p>This is going to sound like an odd suggestion at first, but hear us out! One of the best ways to earn your partner’s trust is to set up an experiment. For example, you and your partner could agree that he/she could “test” you three times in the next couple of weeks or months. For example, he/she could ask you to prove where you are (or where you’ve been) or show receipts for how you’ve spent money. If you’re actually not doing what your partner is worried about, getting some proof of that can be helpful to your partner. On the other hand, knowing that these tests won’t continue forever (it’s only a few times over a period of not more than a few months) can give you confidence that things will get back to normal eventually.</p>\n<h2>I’M HIDING SOMETHING</h2>\n<p>If you are in fact hiding something from your partner, whether it be a credit card charge or an affair, deciding to come clean can be difficult. You may feel caught in the lies that you’ve told and feel that it is too late to come clean to your partner; you might risk losing the relationship. However, the weight, burden, and upkeep of these lies will only continue to grow with time. Consider the following tips:</p>\n<h3>1. BE TRUTHFUL</h3>\n<p>The first step to untangling the web of lies is to be honest with your partner. Although it will likely be a difficult conversation, it is also the first step towards rebuilding trust in your relationship.</p>\n<h3>2. COMMIT TO HONESTY</h3>\n<p>Although you cannot change how you handled difficult topics in the past, you can commit to being honest in the future. It may be hard at first and you and your partner may need to practice your speaker / listener skills during these conversations; however, you partner will notice your effort and likely appreciate it.</p>\n<h3>3. SET YOURSELF UP WELL</h3>\n<p>If particular situations, friends, or events make you more prone to acting in a way that you would lie to your partner about later, consider removing some of those negative influences from your life. While not all can be fully removed, at least limiting your contact can be helpful. Set a plan and let your partner know about it so he/she can know you’re serious about changing your behavior.</p>\n<h3>4. DON’T PUSH YOUR PARTNER TO FORGIVE</h3>\n<p>It’s going to be hard for your partner to find out the truth – especially if you’ve been covering it up for a while. You’ve broken your partner’s trust and it will take time for that to heal. Recognize that, even if your partner wants to forgive you, emotional wounds take time to heal just like physical wounds. It would be naive for your partner to trust you again immediately – you’re going to have to earn it back over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Are one or both of you a member of the military? Do frequent separations due to deployment or job duties cause you to feel disconnected or make it hard to be a team once you are together again? Do you have difficulty communicating with one another due to being away from each other or not being able to discuss work? Have you had to deal with frequent moves or living away from your biggest support system? If so, this post will help you identify how to address these concerns.</p>\n<p>Being a military couple comes with its own unique challenges and sacrifices. You may have to go days, weeks, or months without seeing each other and/or be separated from your closest friends and family. You may also find it hard to stay emotionally connected with each other. Additionally, when one of you returns from deployment, re-integration back into your day-to-day life and routine can be challenging and can be made more difficult by the onset of mental health issues that arose from service. These issues often create the following cycles: &#8220;Day-to-Day Problems&#8221; and &#8220;Issues Around Deployment&#8221;</p>\n<h2>DAY TO DAY PROBLEMS</h2>\n<p>If only one of you is in the military or if you are in two different positions within the military, you may feel hurt when your partner cannot talk about all aspects of his/her job or feel alone when your partner needs to work long hours. If you are the only member of the couple in the military, you may feel guilty that your work takes you away from your family or upset that your partner does not understand the sacrifices you make.</p>\n<h3>The Military Member</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, you might get really frustrated with your partner for not understanding the nature of your work or you may feel guilty that your work gets in the way of the relationship. Tips to change these situation:</p>\n<h4>1. COMMUNICATE</h4>\n<p>Have a conversation with your partner to tell him/her why being in the military is important to you and why you don’t want it to affect your relationship negatively. Ask your partner to share his/her feelings too. Remember your DEEP Understanding and consider how each of the DEEP components could be contributing to both you and your partner’s feelings. Use the Respond conversation to discuss what you can change in how you prioritize your relationship so that the negative impact of your work is lessened.</p>\n<h4>2. STRENGTHEN YOUR RELATIONSHIP</h4>\n<p>Even if you are busy or cannot be open about your work, there are other ways to feel connected with your partner. Decide to prioritize date nights every once in a while or plan to do something fun together at least once a week such as doing a physical activity, cooking together, playing a game, or watching TV.</p>\n<h4>3. RELY ON SUPPORT SYSTEMS</h4>\n<p>Often being in the military can mean living away from friends and family. Recognize that this may be difficult for your partner who moved to support your line of work. Together, try to identify a few people who live close by who you can rely on for support and/or prioritize calling both of your and your partner’s friends and family members more regularly so that you both feel supported.</p>\n<h3>The Non-Military Member</h3>\n<p>If your partner cannot open up about his/her job or is gone frequently due to long hours, you may felt left behind and alone.Tips change these situations:</p>\n<h4>1. THIS IS HARD FOR ME</h4>\n<p>Sometimes, being the non-military member can be filled with loneliness. Especially if this isn’t the core issue you decided to work on, be vulnerable with your partner about how this is hard. Use your DEEP Understanding to better understand why you are feeling the way you are and how it impacts your and your partner’s perspectives. Remember, sharing your hidden emotions can make your partner less likely to be defensive and more likely for the conversation to go smoother.</p>\n<h4>2. RELY ON SUPPORT SYSTEMS</h4>\n<p>Because you are in a military couple, you may be living away from your closest support systems such as family and friends. With your partner’s long hours and possible frequent deployments, this can make you feel isolated from those you love and from a community. Rely on the support of other military spouses who know the challenges you face and when your partner is around, try to integrate those individuals in your lives. As a couple, try to prioritize calling both of your and your partner’s family members and friends so that you can be integrated in their lives and feel more connected as a couple.</p>\n<h2>ISSUES AROUND DEPLOYMENT</h2>\n<p>Deployment can make it hard on both members of the couple to feel connected. Different time zones can make it hard to talk or responsibilities can lead to going days without talking. After deployment, it can be really hard for the person who just returned to feel like a contributing member of the family. He/she may feel isolated from the other partner or could be suffering from mental health concerns as a result of deployment. The partner who was not deployed may want to help, but not know how or could feel confused about having gotten used to a new routine while their partner was away.</p>\n<h3>The Deployed Partner</h3>\n<p>Deployment creates a physical – and often emotional – distance between partners. You may feel distant from your partner during and after your deployment but not know how to make the relationship closer or get the connection back once the deployment ends. Finally, emotional concerns that arose from deployment can make you feel numb or unable to connect to your partner or to your other loved ones. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>1. SET EXPECTATIONS FOR COMMUNICATION DURING DEPLOYMENT</h4>\n<p>If your deployment is coming up, use the Respond Conversation to set expectations for how communication will look during deployment. Consider writing each other letters and/or emails so you can stay connected despite not being able to talk regularly. Talk to each other about how you can keep the communication positive which will help you feel like home life is stable so you can concentrate on your important dangerous work.</p>\n<h4>2. STAY CONNECTED</h4>\n<p>Read the Long Distance Relationship Topic for ideas on how to stay connected despite being far away from each other. Ideas include playing games online, spending quality time together while talking, and strengthening communication. Other ideas include sharing music or listening to a favorite song together, writing letters, or sharing a journal with one another.</p>\n<h4>3. REINTEGRATION</h4>\n<p>Transitioning back home can be challenging. You may be struggling with mental health concerns or emotional problems when you return, which is a very common experience for service members.If so, consider utilizing the free services at your local Military or VA facilities to help you manage the internal struggles you may be facing.</p>\n<h3>The Partner Left Behind</h3>\n<p>As the person left behind, you may feel lonely, hopeless, scared, or any number of difficult emotions about your partner being away. You may really miss him/her while also feeling resentment that he/she chose work over the family. All of those complex feelings make adjustment after deployment more difficult. Additionally, you may not know what to do if your partner returns home with mental health concerns such as PTSD or depression. Tips change these situations:</p>\n<h4><strong>1. SET EXPECTATIONS FOR COMMUNICATION DURING DEPLOYMENT</strong></h4>\n<p>Use the Respond Conversation to set expectations for how communication will look during deployment. Consider writing each other letters and/or emails so you can stay connected despite not being able to talk regularly. Talk to each other about how you can keep the communication positive so that you feel less stressed as the partner left behind and feel joyful in your day to day life despite your partner being away.</p>\n<h4><strong>2. STAY CONNECTED WITH YOUR PARTNER AND YOUR SUPPORT SYSTEM</strong></h4>\n<p>As a couple, it is important to feel emotionally close, despite the distance and sensitive nature of the relationship. Use the tips in the Long Distance Relationship topic to keep this connection alive. Additionally, to feel connected to your community, make sure to access the many military resources available to you (found here) and rely on other spouses who are also dealing with the hardships of deployment</p>\n<h4>3. AFTER DEPLOYMENT</h4>\n<p>For tips on reintegration, click here. Remember, adjustment takes a while and that is ok. If this isn’t the core issue you’re working on, it may be helpful to use the problem solving activity in the Strengthen phase to make a plan for how you can each contribute to a smooth transition back with set expectations for communication, shared house work, and day-today decision making.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Do you and your partner have arguments over parenting? Or maybe you or your partner have children from previous relationships? Is agreeing on ways to parent kids and step-kids difficult for you? If so, this post will help you identify common problems and get some ideas on how to solve them.</p>\n<h2><strong>Issues around parenting can have many forms – which fits you and your relationship?</strong></h2>\n<p>When partners have different views on parenting or different styles, it can create conflict. Additionally, in blended families, families made up of parents, step-parents, kids, and step-kids who come together to make a new family unit, the opinions of outside parents and interactions with current partners can become heated. Often, navigating all the people and opinions that surround parenting can cause significant problems for relationships.</p>\n<h3>GOOD COP / BAD COP</h3>\n<p>One partner may feel that his/her partner is too strict with the children and that his/her own opinion on how to raise the children isn’t heard or taken into consideration. Or one partner could feel unfairly responsible for all the discipline in the household or judged for his/her parenting style.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Strict Parent</strong></h4>\n<p>The more your partner pushes you to lighten up on the kids and have fewer rules, the more you feel the children need structure and discipline. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. KID GOALS </strong></p>\n<p>Sit down with your partner and discuss what your goals are for parenting the children. Make a list of rules together that you can both agree on. This will likely involve some compromise!</p>\n<p><strong>2. SHARE THE DECISION-MAKING</strong></p>\n<p>Try not to criticize your partner or dismiss his/her ideas. Each parent should have a say in the final decision and rules. So, think about the issues you feel really strongly about and maybe let your partner decide some of the other things.</p>\n<p><strong>3. PARENTING BOOKS</strong></p>\n<p>Would reading a book on parenting be an option? Below are several great choices that you and your partner could read together.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Easy-going Parent</strong></h4>\n<p>The more alone you feel in your opinion and frustrated that your partner is hard on the children, the less you feel you have a say in the decisions regarding discipline. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. BE A TEAM</strong></p>\n<p>Do your best to back up your partner in front of the kids. If you disagree about something, try to handle it in advance or after it has happened – somewhere out of earshot of the kids. If the children know the two of you don’t agree, that could create more problems down the road.</p>\n<p><strong>2. SHARE YOUR SIDE</strong></p>\n<p>Try to explain to your partner why you disagree with their parenting style rather than calling it ‘wrong’ or ‘mean’. What are you worried will happen if your partner continues to parent in this way? Do you have any past experiences or emotions that are triggered in these situations? Try framing your thoughts like a DEEP understanding to share with your partner.</p>\n<p><strong>3. BE SPECIFIC</strong></p>\n<p>Do your best to figure out what specifically you would like to see change. Is it the form of discipline (spanking vs time out), expectations for the children, or tone of voice when interacting with the kids?</p>\n<p><strong>4. PARENTING BOOKS</strong></p>\n<p>We learn most of what we know about parenting from experience and observation, but there are lots of other good resources out there, too! Check out some of the options below.</p>\n<h3>YOUR KIDS VS OUR KIDS</h3>\n<p>Partners may not agree on the rules for children or one partner may feel uncomfortable disciplining the other partner’s children.</p>\n<h4>The Non-Biological Parent</h4>\n<p>The more your partner pushes you to become involved with his/her children, the less you want to help. Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<p><strong>1. FUN TIMES</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re struggling to connect with the children, you could set up an activity that you feel confident the whole family will enjoy, especially your partner’s children. Maybe spending time together at the park or at a school function would be an option. This could help by allowing you to feel more comfortable with the children by starting with fun activity.</p>\n<p><strong>2. ROLES</strong></p>\n<p>Discuss with your partner what your role should be with the kids. Does he/she want you to be involved in rule setting and discipline? If so, find a time to decide on what the rules are so you’re not disagreeing about them in front of the kids. Having these conversations early on can help prevent misunderstandings and arguments later. On the flip side, there may be topics or situations where your partner doesn’t want you involved. Getting clarity about what these situations are so you can respect his/her decisions is key.</p>\n<p><strong>3. WORK TOGETHER</strong></p>\n<p>Work with your partner to create a list of tasks or activities that involve the children and find some for you to do. Maybe you could get the kids breakfast in the morning or help check homework after school? Dividing the time when either you or your partner is responsible or in charge keeps both partners involved as parents.</p>\n<p><strong>4. PARENTING BOOKS</strong></p>\n<p>If you don’t have children of your own, you may not feel very comfortable being a parent to your partner’s kids. Or, you could be looking for more ideas how to help. Would reading a parenting book be an option for you? If so, see the ideas below!</p>\n<h4>The Biological Parent</h4>\n<p>The more alone you feel as a parent, the harder it is to express your frustration to your partner in a productive way. Alternately, if you feel your partner is overstepping, finding a way to create balance without shutting him/her out completely can be challenging.</p>\n<p>Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<p><strong>1. ASK “WHY?”</strong></p>\n<p>Ask your partner why he/she isn’t more involved or why he/she is so interested in helping out. Is there something about how he/she raised that is related to how he/she is acting now? Does he/she feel uncomfortable asserting authority over kids who aren’t his/her own? Does he/she feel left out when not involved in parenting?</p>\n<p><strong>2. BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT</strong></p>\n<p>Try to tell your partner specifically what you need. For example, you might want help with watching the kids or support from your partner when you discipline the kids. If you can identify specific changes you want your partner to make, those can be really good things to discuss as part of your “Respond” conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>3.  … AND ABOUT WHAT YOU DON’T WANT</strong></p>\n<p>If your partner is doing things that you wish he/she wouldn’t, that can also be helpful for your partner to hear. But if you’re going to include something like this in the “Respond” conversation, try to also include something you DO want him/her to do.</p>\n<p><strong>4. PARENTING BOOKS</strong></p>\n<p>Would reading a parenting book be an option for you?

      "rendered": "<p>Are you or your partner currently in school or job training? Or are either of you thinking about going back to school or seeking additional job training? If so, this post will help you identify common problems and get some ideas on how to solve them.</p>\n<h2>Issues around School and Job Training can have many forms – which fits your relationship?</h2>\n<p>External Stressors, such as going back to school or seeking additional job training, can cause significant problems for relationships: <strong>&#8220;Now now&#8221;</strong> and <strong>&#8220;This Balancing Act Is Killing Me&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Below are common cycles couples experience around external stressors such as school or job training as well as tips for breaking out of these cycles. Because every couple is different, it’s important to read through each cycle. You might find that more than one applies to you or your partner’s behavior.</p>\n<h3>NOT NOW!</h3>\n<p>Partners may not agree on how important the advanced education or training is or whether the timing is right. If one partner already has a degree or advanced training, seeking further education may seem excessive or unnecessary.</p>\n<h4>The Partner Wanting School/Training</h4>\n<p>You may feel caught between wanting to advance your career and contributing to your relationship right now. It might seem that this investment in yourself may not pay off in the long run. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. OPEN UP</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re feeling really certain you want to go to classes/training despite the barriers, there are likely some strong emotions you’re feeling – be sure to share these hidden emotions with your partner. For example, you might be feeling unappreciated at your current job or like you’re letting yourself / your family down by staying in your current position. If this isn’t your core issue, we suggest you first do the Speaker-Listener conversation in the Strengthen Phase before doing the Problem-Solving conversation activity (also in the Strengthen Phase). If this IS your core issue, then you’ll already follow this pattern.</p>\n<p><strong>2. ASK YOUR PARTNER</strong></p>\n<p>Chances are, if this has become a problem in your relationship, your partner likely has some strong emotions as well. You may be aware of some but not others. So, be sure to ask about your partner’s feelings! If this is hard for you, consider using the Speaker-Listener activity in the Strengthen phase of the program.</p>\n<p><strong>3. PRO CON LIST</strong></p>\n<p>Together with your partner, create a pro/con list about going back to school / getting additional training. You may find that doing this together gets you and your partner on the same page – regardless of the decision. For example, ask: What does tuition cost? Have you saved for tuition? How long would it take to pay back loans? What is job availability like out of school? How much income will you be giving up in order to attend school / training? If this isn’t your core issue, we suggest you use the Problem-Solving conversation in the Strengthen phase of the program.</p>\n<p><strong>4. CONSIDER ALL THE OPTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes our first idea isn’t the best one. Consider:<br />\n• Could you go to school part time? Although it may extend the time of the degree, working part time during school could help offset some of the financial burden on your partner.<br />\n• Could you find an option that would cost less money or take less time? There are a lot of resources online that can help you find free / low-cost training in your area.<br />\n• Are there extended family members that could help out during this period (e.g., with childcare or money)?</p>\n<h4>The Partner Against School/Training</h4>\n<p>School and job training are sometimes seen as a luxury, one that may feel outside of your financial or time capabilities right now. Or, you may not see the need for additional education/training if your partner already has a good job. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. TALK IT OUT</strong></p>\n<p>You probably know by now that we’re big fans of making sure you understand a problem before you try to solve it. If this is a core issue you’ve been working on in the program, you’ve already developed a DEEP understanding. If not, consider using the optional activities in the Strengthen phase to develop a DEEP understanding of this issue. At a minimum, use the optional Speaker-Listener activity in the Strengthen phase to make sure you both share your hidden emotions around this issue.</p>\n<p><strong>2. MAKE A PLAN</strong></p>\n<p>When your partner wants to make this kind of big change, it can feel pretty scary! Try making a long term plan of what school or job training would look like so you have a better idea of what is involved and less is unknown. When are bills due? What major deadlines will your partner have to meet? When are exams? Getting a better idea of when the stressful or “crunch times” are could help you both plan accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>3. RELATIONSHIP GOALS</strong></p>\n<p>Consider sitting down with your partner to jointly discuss what your goals are together for the relationship. Do you want kids? Do you want to travel more? Do you want to move? You can then together discuss whether your partner’s goal for training/ education in line with these relationship goals.</p>\n<p><strong>4. CONSIDER ALL THE OPTIONS </strong></p>\n<p>If your concern has to do with the type of training / education your partner is considering, take a look online to help your partner locate other possibilities for training or education in your area. There may be options (e.g., free, part-time) that would reduce some of your concerns.</p>\n<h3>THIS BALANCING ACT IS KILLING ME!</h3>\n<p>When one partner is in school or seeking further job training, the other partner is also affected. Figuring out together how to handle these extra stressors can be challenging.</p>\n<h4>The Partner In School/Training</h4>\n<p>You may feel overworked trying to do training, keep your relationship strong, take care of kids, maintain friendships, and somewhere find some time for yourself! This is when you most need your partner there for you. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. NOW VS LATER</strong></p>\n<p>Try to prioritize what has to be done now versus what can wait. Assignments for school/training, taking care of the kids, and paying bills are “now” tasks. Even though other things on your plate feel important, ask yourself if they are really priorities.</p>\n<p><strong>2. DIVIDE AND CONQUER</strong></p>\n<p>Sit down with your partner and make a chore list to decide who does what. Figuring out what works with your schedule so you can help with while in school could help ease the weight on your partner. Also, be sure to figure out which times during the day (or which specific tasks) your partner really needs your help. Knowing that can help you make sure you don’t let your partner down when he/she needs you most.</p>\n<p><strong>3. SAY THANKS</strong></p>\n<p>Recognize that when you are in school your partner is picking up extra responsibilities so that you’re able to focus on school/training. Find a way to thank him/her and show your appreciation for all they are doing.</p>\n<h4>The Partner Supporting</h4>\n<p>When your partner is in school or training, extra burden falls to you. This may be financially, childcare, or responsibilities at home like housework and paying bills. It might feel like you are working harder than your partner who is getting the degree! Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. NOW VS LATER</strong></p>\n<p>Try to prioritize what has to be done now versus what can wait. Your job, taking care of the kids, and paying bills are “now” tasks. Even though other things on your plate feel important, ask yourself if they are really priorities.</p>\n<p><strong>2. DIVIDE AND CONQUER</strong></p>\n<p>Sit down with your partner and make a chore list to decide who does what. Also, be sure to figure out when you need the most help from your partner and be sure to prioritize that time / task. If your partner has a lot on his/her plate, it can be helpful to know which items to drop and which to make sure get done.</p>\n<p><strong>3. THIS IS HARD</strong></p>\n<p>Let you partner know what you find most difficult about the situation. Maybe you feel neglected and that he/she don’t have time for you. Maybe you find grocery shopping really stressful! Try to work together to make this difficult time as positive as possible for you both.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Do you and your partner have difficulties because one or both of you finds it hard to express emotions or be open with feelings? Do you have different expectations for how often someone in a relationship should share his/her feelings? Does this lead to you not being as close as a couple or at least one of you feeling as if emotional intimacy is lacking in the relationship? If so, this activity will help you identify how to address these concerns.</p>\n<p>When one or both partners find it difficult to share feelings, it can rob the relationship of emotional closeness and eventually undermine trust in one another. When these issues arise, a difficult cycle can occur leading to relationship distress.</p>\n<h2>HELLO &#8211; ARE YOU THERE? I’VE GOT FEELINGS. WHERE ARE YOURS?</h2>\n<p>When partners differ in expectations around the appropriate frequency, quantity, and depth of emotions that should be shared in a romantic relationship, it can create a lot of hurt and frustration. The expressive partner may feel hurt or angry when his/her partner does not open up. The less expressive partner may feel frustrated when the expressive partner pushes for him/her to express more feelings.</p>\n<h3>The Expressive Partner</h3>\n<p>You may feel vulnerable that you always share how you feel while your partner does not. This can create feelings of loneliness or hurt that he/she doesn’t trust in you enough to be vulnerable. You may also get frustrated because, to you, emotions are an important part of relationships. When your partner is not expressive, you may pull away from your partner or repeatedly ask your partner to open up – and that may lead to your partner withdrawing from you even more.Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<h4>1. REMEMBER NATURAL DIFFERENCES</h4>\n<p>Remember your DEEP Understanding and consider how each of the DEEP components (especially differences in emotional expressiveness) could be contributing to what you and your partner are feelings. If your partner is low in emotional expressiveness, he/she isn’t going to think to do this naturally. So, you may need to decide on situations where this is okay (i.e., that you can accept) and situations where you want to insist your partner be more expressive. Come up with some ground rules you can both follow.</p>\n<h4>2. WHERE’S THE LOVE?</h4>\n<p>Look for other ways your partner shows his/her care. Does he/she hold your hand? Is he/she cuddly? Does he/she take care of things at home? Remember, he/she has feelings too. He/she may just show care in different ways. The trick is to give your partner the space to show affection in his/her own way and to the meaning behind them. If you try to force him/her to show you love in the exact way you want it, then your partner is going to feel overwhelmed and likely pull away.</p>\n<h4>3. OTHER KINDS OF INTIMACY</h4>\n<p>One way to increase emotional intimacy is to increase intimacy in other domains. Your partner may not be emotionally expressive, but there are other ways to connect with your partner that may pull for both of your strengths. If you both are comfortable with touch, consider cuddling, hugs, or sex as a way to feel more connected. Other suggestions include prioritizing date nights every once in a while or planning to do something fun together at least once a week such as doing a physical activity, cooking together, playing a game, or watching TV.</p>\n<h3>The Non-Expressive Partner</h3>\n<p>You may not understand what your partner is asking for when he/she asks you to open up or expresses feeling lonely and unloved when you don’t. Or you may feel uncomfortable sharing emotions even when you can recognize that you’re having some. When your partner pulls away from you or demands you open up, you may feel hurt, frustrated, or annoyed and respond by pulling away. You may also get frustrated because you can think of all the other ways you show your partner you love them and feel annoyed or hurt that your partner accuses you of being cold, unloving, and/or uncaring.Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<h4>1. REMEMBER NATURAL DIFFERENCES</h4>\n<p>When you start feeling frustrated about this, remember your DEEP Understanding and consider how each of the DEEP components (especially possible natural difference in emotional expressiveness) could be contributing to both you and your partner’s feelings. If the two of you are different, it will be important to talk about: a) situations/topics where it’s really important you try your best to open up and b) situations/topics that are really difficult for you to open up and maybe your partner needs to be more accepting of that.</p>\n<h4>2. TRY TO BE VULNERABLE WITH PARTNER</h4>\n<p>It may not be easy for you but one way your relationship will feel closer is if you can share things you usually keep to yourself, you might think of these as “vulnerable” emotions. By sharing your feelings such as when something hurt you or upset you, you will create a space of intimacy. Your partner will appreciate that you’ve opened up and you are likely to feel better that you got something off your chest. If sharing your feelings verbally is harder for you, consider writing your feelings down first and sharing those words with your partner. Or, you could write a letter or card for your partner.</p>\n<h4>3. OTHER KINDS OF CARE</h4>\n<p>Even if you are not comfortable expressing yourself, look for other opportunities to show your feelings such as through touch, cuddling, hand-holding, or remembering something your partner asked you to do around the house. Spending quality time together also indicates care, so you could consider planning a date night or an activity where you will have each other’s undivided attention. By showing your care through other means, your partner may be less likely to ask you to open up verbally to show your care.</p>\n<h2>VULNERABLE EMOTIONS? SHARING? NOT FOR US!</h2>\n<p>In some relationships, both partners find it hard to be open and share vulnerable feelings. As a result, both partners withdraw from each other and don’t share life’s events, whether positive or negative. When this happens, neither person gives their partner a chance to support him/her, robbing the relationship of opportunities to create emotionally-intimate moments. As a result, partners describe feeling like “roommates” and that they really only talk when plans need to be made such as childcare, paying the bills, schedules, etc. So what do you do when these cycle arise? Tips to improve this cycle:</p>\n<h4>1. REMEMBER NATURAL DIFFERENCES</h4>\n<p>Remember your DEEP Understanding and consider how each of the DEEP components (for example, a possible similarity in difficulty with emotional expressiveness or a pattern of both of you avoiding more difficult conversations) could be contributing to both you and your partner’s feelings. It may be that acceptance will help you worry less that the two of you are missing something in your relationship.</p>\n<h4>2. TRY TO BE VULNERABLE WITH EACH OTHER</h4>\n<p>It may not be easy for either of you but being more open can have positive effects. By sharing your feelings such as when something hurt you or upset you, you will create a space of intimacy. Since it may be hard at first to share feelings, try instead opening up about why the process of opening up is hard. You may even learn something about the other that you didn’t know and the process of being open in any capacity is likely to have positive effects on your relationship. Additionally, consider writing your feelings down first and sharing those words with each other. For example, you could both write letters or cards to each other.</p>\n<h4>3. SHARING SOME, BUT NOT ALL, OF THE TIME</h4>\n<p>Work together to identify topics or situations where it’s really important for both of you to fight your natural styles to not share. For example, situations where you’re feeling down/upset about something is often a really important time to reach out to your partner for support.</p>\n<h4>4. OTHER KINDS OF INTIMACY</h4>\n<p>One way to increase emotional intimacy is to increase intimacy in other domains. If you both are comfortable with touch, consider cuddling, hugs, or even sex as a way to feel more connected. Other suggestions include prioritizing date nights every once in a while or planning to do something fun together at least once a week such as doing a physical activity, cooking together, or playing a game.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Do you and your partner have different expectations for how you should handle living apart? For example, do you fight about how often you talk or how you can keep the connection despite the distance? Or has living apart interfered with one or both of you feeling emotionally close? If so, this blog post will help you identify how to address these concerns.</p>\n<p>Living apart from a partner is never easy. Because you may go a long time without seeing each other, the literal distance can often create emotional distance or a feeling that this relationship is not a priority to one or both partners. It can also create a problem when one partner’s expectations about long distance is different from the other’s. These issues often create the following cycle:</p>\n<p><em><strong>We Love Each Other, but This Doesn’t Always Feel Like a Relationship</strong></em></p>\n<p>You may both want to feel closer, but don’t know how to make it happen, or you may fight about one partner caring more to stay connected. Additionally, when you are together, it might be hard to prioritize couple time while also trying to spend time with friends and family. So what do you do?</p>\n<p>The more you fight about long distance, the more frustration or hurt you may feel. Moreover, long distance can make it harder to share the mundane day-to-day activities, challenges, and accomplishments of each of your lives, which can lead to feeling disconnected and lonely. Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h2>TALK ABOUT YOUR DAY</h2>\n<p>Geographically close couples often talk about the little events in life that have either happened or are upcoming &#8211; which over time builds closeness and intimacy; however, when in a long distance relationship, it can be easy to forget to include your partner in these small life details. Therefore, start every call with taking five minutes to ask each other how your days were and to share in each other’s worlds, even when miles apart.</p>\n<h2>MAKE THE MINUTES COUNT</h2>\n<p>Long distance couples often think that talking all the time is the solution to their feelings of disconnectedness. But sometimes, this can create more problems. Think about it. When you live close to someone, you likely don’t call them every five minutes to say hi. Instead, you probably wait until something big happens or after work/school to talk. One recommendation then is for you to prioritize quality of conversation versus quantity. If you are always on the phone with nothing to say, you may start resenting each other. Instead, make the most of the calls you have and when you are on the phone with each other, share your day, talk about how much you miss each other, or talk about your shared values and interests. Additionally, consider being creative by sending each other pictures, audio clips, or videos. When you each put in this effort to stay connected, you’re both more likely to feel loved and attended to.</p>\n<h2>SET SOME GROUND RULES</h2>\n<p>Long distance couples often differ on how much time to spend on the phone, how much to say, whether to use the phone or Skype/Gchat/FaceTime, etc., and/or who is commuting for the next visit. This can often cause a lot of tension. If this is true for you, use the Respond conversation to discuss your expectations for how you can both feel fulfilled in the relationship. Remember, there might be parts of the DEEP Understanding which can help you better understand your partner’s point of view.</p>\n<h2>MIX UP YOUR TIME TOGETHER</h2>\n<p>When you’re together, try to do activities alone (just the two of you) as well as activities together with friends or family. When one person is long distance, it’s important that person get to know friends/family and be a part of the partner’s social life. That way, when the partner talks about things that have happened with friends/family, the long-distance person can know those people and be involved in the conversation. Involving the long-distance person in the partner’s social life also communicates to other that your relationship is important – potentially protecting it against unwanted advances by other potential partners.</p>\n<h2>DATE EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH YOU’RE MILES APART</h2>\n<p>Geographically close couples often prioritize date nights every once in a while. Don’t let the miles between you stop you from doing the same. There are plenty of activities that can be done such as watching a TV show at the same time or playing an online game that will allow you to take each other out on a date or feel connected.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Do you and your partner disagree over how much you communicate with one another? Does one person’s desire to share more – either frequently or deeply – cause discomfort and conflict in the relationship? This blog post will help you identify common problems around lack of communication and give you some ideas on how to solve it.</p>\n<h2>Issues Around Lack of Communication Can Have Different Forms</h2>\n<p>The frequency or depth of communication that each person is comfortable with will differ between partners, and many couples find it tricky to find a balance that is satisfying to both people. Often times, one person feels alone from the lack of communication while the other feels overwhelmed or smothered. Couples struggling with lack of communication tend to experience one of two common cycles: not talking often and avoiding deeper feelings.</p>\n<h3>1. NOT TALKING OFTEN</h3>\n<p>When one of you wants to share everything and the other is more private, both members feel frustrated with the amount or frequency of communication.</p>\n<h3>The One Who is Always Talking</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, you might get really frustrated with your partner for not starting conversation, not checking in with you throughout the day, or just being preoccupied about something else. You feel like you’re doing your part, but they just don’t respond. It feels like you’re living with a stranger! Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>A. SCHEDULE TALK TIME</h4>\n<p>Rather than starting up important conversations as soon as they come to your mind or as soon as you seen your partner, let him/her know that you would like to plan a time to talk. Let your partner know (briefly) what the topic is about so that you can both come to the conversation ready to talk about the topic at hand.</p>\n<h4>B. TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE</h4>\n<p>If you are a talker, an extrovert, or just love communicating (and your partner doesn’t), try to find other outlets for your love for connection. Chat with friends or family on the phone, or try to find a job or volunteer work that allows you to use your social side.</p>\n<h4>C. AGREE TO A SIGNAL</h4>\n<p>You and your partner can work together to agree on a signal that indicates he/she is tired of talking and needs a break. This signal doesn’t excuse him/her from the conversation – you should both agree on a time to come back to it. But taking a break can be helpful for both partners to clear their heads before coming back together to continue talking.</p>\n<h3>The Silent One</h3>\n<p>When you are the less talkative one in a couple, your partner’s constant desire to share can be overwhelming and turn you off to talking about anything. The more they push, the more you withdraw. You want to know about the important stuff about your partner – but it’s not all important stuff! Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>A. START SMALL</h4>\n<p>Figure out what little changes you can make to share more with your partner. Maybe send them a quick text about what you are doing when you are apart. Or, commit to sharing one story from your day with your partner each evening. Just sharing the best and worst thing from your day can help your partner feel more part of your life.</p>\n<h4>B. FIND COMMON GROUND</h4>\n<p>Is there a hobby or interest that you and your partner both enjoy that you can connect over? Whether it be your children or a new episode of a TV show, finding something you are both passionate about can be a great way to start talking more.</p>\n<h4>C. AGREE TO A SIGNAL</h4>\n<p>You and your partner can work together to agree on a signal that indicates when you are tired of talking and need a break. This signal doesn’t excuse you from the conversation – you should both agree on a time to come back to it – but taking a break can be helpful for both partners to clear their heads before coming back together to continue talking.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>2. AVOIDING DEEPER FEELINGS</h3>\n<p>Even if you and your partner talk pretty regularly, sharing the deeper feelings and more private parts of ourselves with our partner can sometimes be challenging. Sharing hidden emotions is difficult to do. When one or both partners struggle to open up and share these vulnerable feelings, it can make the relationship feel surface level or leave you feeling emotionally distanced from your partner. Tips to improve this problem:</p>\n<h4>A. VALIDATE WHAT YOUR PARTNER SHARES</h4>\n<p>When your partner opens up to share a hidden emotion with you or shares a deeper feeling, validate it! Thank them for being vulnerable with you, paraphrase what you heard them say (like when you are in the listener role). Try your best not to disagree with what they are feeling or compete with their emotions (e.g. “you were sad, well I was devastated!”). Every person is entitled to their own feelings, and when you partner shares one of those with you, let them know you understand them – even if you don’t agree.</p>\n<h4>B. FOCUS ON YOUR SHARING</h4>\n<p>Although it might be easier to wait for your partner to start one of these deep conversations or share a hidden emotion, remember you are working together as a team, and change starts with you! It’s okay, and even good, to let your partner know you are nervous about sharing.</p>\n<h4>C. SHARE SMART</h4>\n<p>If you try to start a deep conversation while your partner is cooking dinner, the baby is crying, and the TV is blaring, you probably know from experience that it isn’t going to go anywhere. Instead, pick a time to have these conversations when both you and your partner can focus on one another – just like you’ve been doing with the conversations in the program. Whether it is early morning or in the evening that works best, pick a time when both of you can focus on one another with few interruptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Do you and your partner have trouble making decisions, finding compromise, or problem solving issues? Communicating effectively so both partners feel heard and are satisfied with the result is no easy task! Finding a compromise between two different people can be hard to do—especially if it’s about a topic that touches on hidden emotions. If you’re in this situation, it is likely difficult for you and your partner to agree on a middle ground. Or if you can find a compromise, maybe you have trouble putting your plan into action. Couples struggling with decision making tend to experience one of two common cycles: Finding the middle ground, and all talk no walk.</p>\n<h2>Finding The Middle Ground</h2>\n<p>My partner wants one thing. I want the opposite. Where do we even begin? Many couples struggle to compromise when trying to solve difficult issues. You may argue about which one of you should compromise, or where compromise even starts. Sometimes, it can be hard to balance the needs and desires of each person, and each person is unwilling to give up what is important to him/her. When that happens, it may create fights in the relationship.</p>\n<h3>1. FAIR IN THE LONG RUN MAY NOT BE FAIR IN THE SHORT RUN</h3>\n<p>Sometimes it’s really hard to find a compromise that feels fair – either because there is no middle ground (it’s a Yes or No decision) or because you both feel really strongly about the issue. If that’s the case, consider letting one person “win” this time with the agreement that the other person will “win” the next time you have a situation where the two of you can’t find a compromise. For you basketball fans out there, this is the “possession arrow” idea – when there is a tie-up and both teams have equal claim to the ball, they take turns getting the ball. Ideally, the two of you don’t keep rigid score but instead have a general sense about who has sacrificed more recently for the good of the relationship.</p>\n<h3>2. FOCUS ON SELF CHANGE</h3>\n<p>Remember that you and your partner are working together as a team. So, be sure to consider ways you can improve or prevent the pattern by changing the way you act before and during a discussion of the core issue. After all, you and your partner are both at least partially responsible for the issues you two have, and some problems may have started with something either of you did (or didn’t do). At the end of the day, being in a relationship means sometimes putting the “we” ahead of the “I” in order to make a relationship work.</p>\n<h3>3. BRAINSTORM FREELY &amp; CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS</h3>\n<p>Know that when you’re brainstorming ways to compromise, no idea is stupid. Then, when you’ve developed a few ideas, put one of them to the test. Try an idea out for a short period of time, knowing you’ll re-evaluate it soon at a later date. Be sure to hold back any judgment of yourself or your partner during this process.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>All Talk Not Walk</h2>\n<p>It’s great when you and your partner agree to a compromise, but it can be frustrating when it feels like no actions or changes result from it.</p>\n<h3>The Partner Trying to Change</h3>\n<p>“Why am I the only one working on this? Didn’t we both agree to change?” Sometimes, you might get really frustrated with your partner for not following through on what you talked about. You feel that you are holding up your end of the bargain and he/she is letting you down again.Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>1. FRUSTRATION GETS IN THE WAY</h4>\n<p>When you realize that you’re not yet making the progress you expected, or when you think your partner isn’t trying, it can be really frustrating. When we’re really upset, angry, or stressed, we tend to get defensive or lash out at our partners – despite our best intentions. When this happens, don’t expect yourself or your partner to be able to make the changes you’ve been talking about. Instead, take a break, call a time out, and come back to it when you’re feeling better.</p>\n<h4>2. WHY IS THIS SO HARD FOR MY PARTNER?</h4>\n<p>If the change is harder or more complicated than your partner expects, try to remember that your partner gave the change a try but the plan the two of you worked out didn’t work. In other words, try not to get upset, angry, or frustrated with your partner. Instead, this can be a good time to modify the initial solutions you came up with. It’s not unusual to have to try a few different solutions before finding one that works. In fact, we’ve even built this into the OurRelationship program! In the optional Strengthen phase, you’ll have a chance to re-evaluate how the changes you decided on in the Respond phase are going and make changes to those plans.</p>\n<h4>3. MY PARTNER KEEPS FALLING INTO OUR OLD PATTERN</h4>\n<p>If you realize that the problem is happening but your partner doesn’t, use a non-blaming label to describe what’s going on. Sometimes a simple “I think we’re getting into it again” can be enough to allow you both to shift gears, consider your DEEP understanding, and apply any relevant changes your partner agreed to. And the more often you label the problem when it occurs, the easier it will become for your partner to recognize the problem when it comes up</p>\n<h4>4. WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM</h4>\n<p>Remember that you’re working together as a team to make things better. Sometimes you’re not going to do a great job. And sometimes your partner isn’t going to do a good job. But, if you notice your partner having trouble with the change, try to help them out. Helping each other rather than attacking each other is going to go a long way in improving your relationship.</p>\n<h3>The Other Partner</h3>\n<p>“I’m doing my best to follow through on our agreement! But it’s hard to change.”</p>\n<p>When you and your partner make a compromise to try things differently, it can be hard to remember to actually do it. Sometimes, what seemed like a good idea turns out to not work so well.Tips to change these situations:</p>\n<h4>1. UNDERSTAND THE BARRIERS TO CHANGE</h4>\n<p>Even when we decide to take the risk to change and give it our best shot, there are always things that get in our way. When you start trying out the change, it may just feel “weird” or awkward for a while. This tends to be most common when you’re trying to do more positives (instead of fewer negatives). Let your partner know if you’re feeling stuck, and try to brainstorm ways to navigate around each barrier.</p>\n<h4>2. CHANGE IS HARDER THAN EXPECTED</h4>\n<p>Despite our best efforts, sometimes the solutions we come up with aren’t working like we hoped. We’re doing our best to change but either those changes aren’t really solving the problem or the changes are just too difficult to do for a long period of time. This can be a good time to re-evaluate the initial solutions you came up with, and develop new solutions that may get at the heart of the problem or be easier to enact. Talk to your partner and find a time to talk about this – ignoring the fact that you’re not following through on your initial agreements is only going to make it worse!</p>\n<h4>3. IT’S HARD TO RECOGNIZE WHEN THE PROBLEM IS HAPPENING</h4>\n<p>If identifying the problem in the moment is going to be a problem for you, talk to your partner about your concerns. Your partner may be able to help you by saying something like “I think we’re getting into it again.” Something that simple can be enough to let you take a step back and let your DEEP understanding and change plan kick in. And the more often you label the problem when it occurs, the easier it becomes for you to recognize the problem when it comes up.</p>\n<h4>4. WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM</h4>\n<p>Remember that you’re working together as a team to make things better. Sometimes you’re not going to do a great job. And sometimes your partner isn’t going to do a good job. But, if you notice you’re having trouble with the change, try to talk it out with your partner. If you need help getting the conversation going, try using the Speaker Listener or Problem Solving conversation structures in the program!</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>It’s common, if not inevitable, that you and your partner will have arguments now and again. But when you and your partner have trouble stopping an argument once it stops, it can have a real impact on your ability to communicate effectively.</p>\n<p>Tips to improve this problem:</p>\n<h2>1. Recognize When You Need a Time Out</h2>\n<p>If you or your partner are feeling cornered, attacked, or need a break from the conversation, it’s best to stop the conversation. Think about what signs there are that things are starting to get out of hand (such as, “I start feeling tense” or “he gets louder” or “she starts cursing”). When you notice these signs in the moment, tell your partner it’s time for a time out.</p>\n<h2>2. Take a Time Out</h2>\n<p>If you or your partner are ready for a time out, be careful not to just walk away – that’s just going to make things worse. Instead, tell the other partner that the two of you can talk about it later when you’ve both calmed down or thought more about it. Your partner may want to set a specific time to revisit the issue (such as “after the kids go to bed” or “after I get home”) and stick to that promise.</p>\n<h2>3. Let You and Your Partner Recover</h2>\n<p>There isn’t a right or wrong way to recover from a fight. Do try to clear your head and not continue having the argument in your thoughts. Take a walk, play a video game, or take a hot shower – whatever helps you relax. When one of you notices the other is still struggling with the argument, try to resist the urge to convince him/her that everything is fine or to make judgments about whether or not they’re over it yet. Letting your partner process in his/her own way without trying to speed it up may decrease the likelihood of another fight. Your partner may also really appreciate you letting him/her deal with it in their own way.</p>\n<h2>4. Timing Back In</h2>\n<p>Give yourselves time to recover from the argument before “timing in” again. That may take the edge off some of your emotions and allow you to talk about it more calmly. Decide how you and your partner will let each other know that you’re ready to revisit the discussion again and agree on it before another fight occurs. Once you’re ready to “time in” again, use the Speaker/Listener structure to either discuss how you’re feeling about the topic, or problem solve the issue. Recall that problem solving can be broken down into 4 steps:</p>\n<h3>1) Define the problem</h3>\n<h3>2) Brainstorm solutions to the problem</h3>\n<h3>3) Decide which changes you’d each like to make</h3>\n<h3>4) Set a time to re-evaluate how those changes are working in the near future</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Arguments are a part of every relationship but if you find yourselves having heated disagreements over the same issues over and over again, or if every conversation with your partner ends up in a fight, you may be trapped in a never-ending cycle of relationship arguments. Find out how to recognize the warning signs and address your specific argument patterns to turn relationship conflict into opportunity</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“One minute we’re talking about our weekend plans and the next minute we’re screaming at each other.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Have you noticed that even small topics quickly cascade into full-blown arguments with your partner? This is a very common pattern in relationship arguments and resolving it depends on two critical steps: recognizing the signs and addressing the underlying issues.</p>\n<h2>1. Know the warning signs</h2>\n<p>Every couple is different so recognizing the warning signs will depend on you and your partner’s unique communication style. Typically, things such as walking away from a talk, raising your voice or switching to accusatory style, and using heated language point to a discussion quickly snowballing into an argument. If you notice any of these signs (or other, more characteristic of you and your partner), check in with your partner. Sometimes, bad timing is to blame: find out if this is a bad time for them to have a conversation and together figure out when a good time may be. Avoid speaking down or the “mind-reading” trap: trying to read into what your partner is saying and interpreting it for the worse. Steer the conversation back to the original topic if you find yourself drifting back to old, unresolved issues.</p>\n<h2>2. Speaking/listening skills</h2>\n<p>One of the key issues that turn discussions into relationship arguments is talking over each other. Focus on your speaking and listening skills, instead. Try the Speaker/Listener exercise:<br />\nthe partner in the speaker role shares their point and does their best to open up. Once finished, the Listener recaps what they’ve heard, which gives the Speaker an opportunity to<br />\nclarify misunderstandings. After this, swap roles and try your best to avoid using any blaming or judging language in either role.</p>\n<h2>3. Break the cycle</h2>\n<p>Do you find you and your partner seem to have the same argument over and over again? Typically, this is a sign that you’re’ leaving arguments unresolved. These can “bleed” into later discussions and escalate even innocent topics into full-blown shouting matches. When you find yourself struggling with a problem, use the Speaker/Listener dynamics to resolve it fully.</p>\n<h2>4. Write it down</h2>\n<p>This approach to conflict resolution is particularly suitable if you would like to discuss a partner’s pain point or revisit an old argument. Writing your thoughts and feelings down can<br />\nhelp you structure them better. Go over the text before you hand it to your partner to ensure there are no instances of blaming or judging language to avoid being sucked into the same<br />\npattern.</p>\n<h2>5. Know when to avoid discussion</h2>\n<p>To avoid relationship arguments, know the appropriate times to have “a talk”. Steer clear of serious topics if you or your partner are distracted (e.g. driving), surrounded by friends, children or family, if either of you is tired, hungry or ill, and on special occasions (as emotions are already heated). Follow these tips the next time you feel yourself and your partner being sucked into the cycle of never-ending relationship arguments.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Do you and your partner have different expectations for how much time you spend together? Does one of you think you should spend more time together while the other wants more alone time?</p>\n<p>There is no right or wrong answer when it comes to how much time you should spend with your significant other because every couple is different. What works for one couple might not work for another.</p>\n<p>When spending time together, it&#8217;s important to find a perfect time balance that is going to benefit your specific relationship.</p>\n<p>While our <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">online couple&#8217;s therapy</a> is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804631/\">scientifically proven to benefit relationships</a>, these tips can first provide you with a solid foundation for time spent together in your relationship.</p>\n<h2>For the Partner Who Wants More &#8220;Us&#8221; Time</h2>\n<p>Do you resent the time your partner wants to spend by themselves because you think it shows that your relationship is <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/170922_114041_m30/index.html#/id/co-100\">not important to them</a>?</p>\n<p>This is a valid feeling, and you&#8217;re not the only person who feels like this. The more your partner wants alone time, the more you feel not cared.</p>\n<p>You may push for more time together, which may make your partner pull away. Or, you may withdraw from the relationship to protect yourself.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it can feel like no matter what you do, you can&#8217;t win. However, there are some ways that you can fix this problem in your relationship.</p>\n<h3>1. Reveal Your Hidden Emotions</h3>\n<p>You may feel hurt that your partner wants to spend time alone, and it is important to express how you feel. When you communicate this, try not to demand that your partner changes. Instead, try to be vulnerable and share with your partner exactly why it is important to you spending time together.</p>\n<p>Maybe hidden emotions are playing a role or maybe natural differences are intensifying the problem. Whatever it may be, it is important to discuss what you are feeling.</p>\n<h3>2. Seek Out Your Partner&#8217;s Hidden Emotions</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s a big difference between your partner not wanting to be with you and your partner wanting to do an activity that doesn&#8217;t involve both of you. It is easy to assume that time apart is evidence that your partner doesn&#8217;t care about you.</p>\n<p>However, that might not be the problem at all, and you won&#8217;t know until you communicate. So, talk about it with your partner!</p>\n<h3>3. Grow Your Social Group</h3>\n<p>No one can be everything to anyone. In other words, it&#8217;s healthy to have more than one person you can open up to, depend on, and have fun with. So, if your partner is the only person who fills those needs for you, we&#8217;d recommend you try to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/how-make-friends-adult-ncna860971\">expand your social group</a>.</p>\n<p>That way, if your partner needs to enjoy their alone time, you can also go enjoy your time apart with a new social group. This will create a balance between your social life and your relationship, which is necessary for romantic relationships.</p>\n<h3>4. Respect Your Partner&#8217;s Differences</h3>\n<p>People often differ on how much time they want to spend alone or with other people. If your partner needs time alone, the most likely explanation is that it helps your partner recharge their batteries.</p>\n<p>By giving your partner their alone time, they will be more refreshed and more likely to be present the next time you spend time together. For your partner, there may be a lot of truth in the saying &#8220;absence makes the heart grow fonder&#8221;.</p>\n<p>While you may not feel the same, it is important to recognize that no two people are exactly the same. It is also important to realize that alone time does not mean your partner doesn&#8217;t want to be around you, but that they just don&#8217;t want to be around anyone.</p>\n<h3>5. Make the Most of Time Spent Together</h3>\n<p>When you&#8217;re together, try not to worry about when it will end. Be present in the moment and recognize enjoying time spent with your partner. Your partner will appreciate how relaxing your time spent together is, which might increase the likelihood of it happening more often!</p>\n<h2>For the Partner Who Wants More &#8220;Me&#8221; Time</h2>\n<p>Do you feel that you need to take time for yourself or else you may begin to resent your partner? Do you feel that the more your partner pushes you to spend time together, the more resentful you feel?</p>\n<p>These are emotions are not unheard of in relationships. A common reaction to these emotions may be to just simply withdraw yourself from the situation to avoid conflict.</p>\n<p>However, that might not be the best way to handle this problem in your relationship. Instead, try implementing some of these tips to help you handle how much time you spend with your partner.</p>\n<h3>1. A Deep Understanding</h3>\n<p>Remember your deep understanding, natural differences, emotions, external stress, and communication patterns play a role in your relationship. For example, if your partner is wanting more time together, their hidden emotions may pop up when you don&#8217;t make that time.</p>\n<p>Try to put yourself in your partner&#8217;s shoes and recognize where their hurt feelings are coming from. Validate your partner by communicating that you appreciate how much the relationship means to them.</p>\n<h3>2. Compromise</h3>\n<p>You may need time for yourself to recharge your batteries, but you should also prioritize time together with your partner. Identify instances during the week when you and your partner can spend uninterrupted time together.</p>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t always about what you do when you spend time with your partner. The important part is that you are making an effort to spend time with your partner. You could even consider involving your partner in some of the activities you currently do by yourself or with your friends. Just taking that initiative to include them in your life can make all of the difference.</p>\n<h3>3. Be Specific About Your Needs</h3>\n<p>It is completely understandable if you want to take time to yourself. However, when you do take time for yourself, make sure to communicate why you need time so your partner understands it is not because of relationship problems.</p>\n<p>You may say something such as, &#8220;I am feeling stressed or overwhelmed and a few hours by myself will make me feel better so that I can be better when we spend time together next.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Again, taking that initiative to show that you are putting in effort can make all of the difference.</p>\n<h3>4. Be Specific About Spending Time Together</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s important not only to spend more time with your partner, but also to be on the same page about <a href=\"https://bucketlistjourney.net/couples-bucket-list-things-to-do/\">spending time together</a>. If one of you thinks an activity counts as time spent together while the other one does not, then the lack of communication could be damaging to your time together.</p>\n<p>You and your partner don&#8217;t have to have the same exact interests as each other. In fact, differences in opinion and free time choices are often encouraged in order to diversify your relationship. Instead of trying to find something that both of you want to do, take turns letting each other choose the date, movie, or restaurant.</p>\n<p>Without the added fighting, you&#8217;ll each be able to better enjoy your time together.</p>\n<h2>Balancing Spending Time Together</h2>\n<p>Remember that it&#8217;s important to consider your partner&#8217;s view and why they feel strongly about the issue. Also, start by making your own changes first as this will increase the likelihood that your partner will also make changes.</p>\n<p>When spending time together, make sure it is quality time. The more you increase the quality of the time spent together, the more your relationship will grow, even if the amount of time spent together is not as frequent as one of you may like. Let your partner know how much you appreciate the time spent together.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

Unsure of what you can do to get your relationship back on track? Well, don&#8217;t fret &#8212; we&#8217;re here to help with tips, tricks, and insights on how to give and get emotional support in your relationship.</p>\n<h2>What is Emotional Support?</h2>\n<p>Emotional support comes in a variety of sizes and shapes. At its core, however, emotional support is about providing love, support, reassurance, acceptance, and encouragement <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">in a relationship</a>. It&#8217;s especially important in times of stress or sadness as it stabilizes the relationship and provides a positive foundation for both partners.</p>\n<h2>What are the Signs a Relationship Lacks Emotional Support?</h2>\n<p>In order to address and improve emotional support within a relationship, you need to be able to identify when a relationship is lacking it. Here are some signs a relationship is lacking emotional support:</p>\n<h3>You and Your Partner Feel Distant</h3>\n<p>Without true emotional intimacy and support, you and your partner are bound to drift. Perhaps you and your partner are talking less or aren&#8217;t spending as much time together as you used to. If you&#8217;re not fueling your feelings of togetherness and connection, your relationship&#8217;s emotional support will ultimately break down.</p>\n<h3>You Don&#8217;t Discuss Your Emotions</h3>\n<p>Another sign your relationship is lacking emotional support is if you and your partner aren&#8217;t being fully honest or forthcoming with each other. When you don&#8217;t talk about feelings or emotions, you&#8217;re more likely to bottle up toxic ones or push your partner away out of fear. So do your best to open up about your daily problems and anxieties, and keep the lines of communication as open as possible.</p>\n<h3>You&#8217;re Leading Separate Lives</h3>\n<p>With this scenario, you and your partner aren&#8217;t only emotionally distant; you&#8217;re also spending very little time with each other. Maybe you don&#8217;t text much or go out on as many dates, or perhaps you&#8217;ve drawn up two distinctly different social groups.</p>\n<p>You should want your partner involved in your life and desire to spend a lot of time with them. If you don&#8217;t want to do this or feel uncomfortable doing so, you most likely have an emotionally distant relationship.</p>\n<h3>You&#8217;re Struggling with Listening Problems</h3>\n<p>Even if you and your partner are having frequent conversations, your emotional intimacy is lacking if you aren&#8217;t actively listening to each other. This can cause a myriad of problems like forgetting important birthdays, anniversaries, or failing to truly understand what the other person is trying to say in moments of vulnerability. You can address this problem by practicing active listening, and intentionally communicating and connecting with your partner with compassion and presence.</p>\n<h3>You&#8217;re Not Physically Intimate</h3>\n<p>Another big sign your relationship is lacking emotional support is if you and your partner aren&#8217;t engaging in physical intimacy. Partners who are unable to emotionally support each other find it more difficult to provide physical support to one another. If they&#8217;re avoiding your physical touch, talk to them and try to get at the root of where your physical intimacy issues stem.</p>\n<h2>How to Give (and Get) Emotional Support</h2>\n<p>Now that you know the signs of emotional support issues, you&#8217;re probably wondering how you and your partner can better support each other. Here are some expert tips to help you address your emotional intimacy and support issues:</p>\n<h3>Ask Questions</h3>\n<p>One of the most important parts of supporting your partner is showing up for them and actively listening to what they have to say. Show you have interest in what they have to say and express love and support as they answer any questions you have. Use <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/faq/\">open-ended questions</a> to evoke true discussion and let them say whatever it is they need to say.</p>\n<p>While listening, make sure to give your partner your undivided attention. Put away your phone and anything else that could pose as a distraction. Maintain eye contact, keep open body language, and use nonverbal cues to show them you&#8217;re receptive to what they&#8217;re saying.</p>\n<h3>Validate Their Feelings</h3>\n<p>Your focus in giving emotional support should be providing your partner with safe space where they can feel heard. This means avoiding giving advice unless you are specifically asked and refraining from telling the other person what they&#8217;re actually feeling or thinking. <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/relationship-advice_b_2127394\">Reassure your partner</a> their feelings are normal and you aren&#8217;t here to judge or criticize what they&#8217;re saying.</p>\n<h3>Show Your Support</h3>\n<p>If someone is expressing they need more emotional support, chances are they need help finding a way to feel emotionally centered again. Ask &#8220;what-if&#8221; questions and present options to them in a question format. Just remember you&#8217;re not there to fix their problems, but rather there to provide them support in finding a solution to their issue.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to show your support in tangible ways. Think of any concrete ways you can help or support them based on what they said. Do whatever you can to help them accomplish their action steps.</p>\n<h3>Provide Physical Touch</h3>\n<p>When it comes to romantic relationships, physical touch is incredibly important in communicating support. This touch doesn&#8217;t have to be explicitly sexual. Simple types of physical contact like walking arm in arm and cuddling can do wonders for emotional support issues.</p>\n<h3>Be Supportive of Your Partner in Public</h3>\n<p>Emotional support isn&#8217;t something you only have to do in private. Complimenting your partner in front of other people and speaking positively about them in front of their peers can make them feel great about themselves and you.</p>\n<h3>Give Small Gifts</h3>\n<p>Keep your romance alive by giving your partner gifts when they least expect. These gifts don&#8217;t have to be expensive, just trinkets or things that remind them how much you care about them. This makes both people in the relationship feel great.</p>\n<h3>Say &#8220;I Love You&#8221;</h3>\n<p>Sometimes the greatest way to show support to your partner is by saying &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/132111-heres-how-often-you-should-say-i-love-you-to-your-partner\">I love you</a>.&#8221; These three words provide the ultimate reassurance to any partner and can help them navigate any hardships they&#8217;re having inside or outside of the relationship.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts on Giving and Getting Emotional Support</h2>\n<p>Relationships aren&#8217;t easy; they need work and compromise, and can often be downright stressful and disheartening. But you shouldn&#8217;t let emotional support issues sabotage the relationship you have. By reviewing the tips and techniques in this article, you can show your partner you&#8217;re there for them, rebuild your relationship, and get things back on track.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

Many of these everyday issues can be overcome with some conversation and compromise.</p>\n<p>How do you know when your problems could use outside help like couples counseling?</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no perfect answer, but talking to a therapist is almost always a good idea. You might feel embarrassed at first, but a therapist isn&#8217;t there to judge. They just help you work through your troubles and give you tools to communicate better.</p>\n<p>Having trouble working through problems with your significant other? Read on for 10 common signs that you and your partner might benefit from couples counseling.</p>\n<h2>1. You&#8217;re Always Having the Same Fights</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re having the same fights over and over again, that&#8217;s a good sign that a therapist might be needed to help resolve it. It&#8217;s not helpful to just argue in circles.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s true even if the recurring fight is something small.</p>\n<p>You and your partner might constantly argue about doing the dishes. On their own, dirty dishes probably won&#8217;t put an end to your marriage. However, if it&#8217;s causing tension on a daily basis, that little fight might be a <a href=\"https://hellogiggles.com/love-sex/relationships/9-signs-little-fights-with-signficant-other-are-serious/\">sign of a larger issue</a>.</p>\n<p>When your partner always neglects the dishes it might make you feel like you have no support. You might also feel that lack of support in other areas in your relationship.</p>\n<p>The dishes just become an easy thing to fight about, when really there&#8217;s something bigger at play.</p>\n<h2>2. You Never Fight</h2>\n<p>Daily blow-out fights are an obvious sign that a relationship is in peril. However, never fighting is also a big sign, it&#8217;s just a little harder to notice.</p>\n<p>Fighting is natural in a long term relationship. If you&#8217;re not arguing once and a while, it might just mean you&#8217;re ignoring your issues altogether.</p>\n<p>Never fighting probably means that there&#8217;s a breakdown in communication. When you&#8217;re not airing out your issues to each other it causes other problems.</p>\n<p>You might begin to quietly resent your partner for something they don&#8217;t even know they&#8217;re doing. That resentment will build until it eventually explodes.</p>\n<p>Going to a therapist together will help you to bring up issues in a safe, neutral environment. Your therapist will also teach you how to better communicate together at home.</p>\n<h2>3. Recent or Upcoming Life Changes</h2>\n<p>Big changes or traumas can rock a relationship. That could be a death, a move, a new job or anything else that disrupts you or your partner&#8217;s life.</p>\n<p>You can visit a therapist after you&#8217;ve realized that this change is hurting your relationship. An even better idea is to talk to someone preemptively.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always easier to talk about your concerns before they happen or become unmanageable. That way you can both be aware and sensitive when and if they do come up.</p>\n<h2>4. You&#8217;re Having Issues with Physical Intimacy</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s to be expected that the raw passion you felt for your partner in the beginning will wane over time. But, if one or both of you are unhappy with your sex life, it might be time to see a therapist.</p>\n<p>Physical intimacy issues can mean different things to different couples.</p>\n<p>It could mean you&#8217;re on different pages about how often it should happen. Maybe one partner experienced a trauma that affects how they express physical intimacy. Perhaps you&#8217;re just not having any sex at all!</p>\n<p>Either way, talking about your needs and desires with your partner can be difficult. You might feel embarrassed or afraid to hurt the other&#8217;s feelings. Having someone else there to guide you can make all the difference.</p>\n<h2>5. You Have Differing Views About Money</h2>\n<p>Aside from physical intimacy, finances is another <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-fights-couples-have-2017-12\">common issue between couples</a>. The way you spend and make your money affects both partners. If you have differing views on the subject, it can drive a huge wedge between you.</p>\n<p>A person&#8217;s habits surrounding money is something that&#8217;s often deeply ingrained since childhood. If you have opposing views on the matter, it can be difficult to resolve it on your own. Because finances will always be a part of your lives together, this problem will keep coming up until it&#8217;s fixed.</p>\n<h2>6. You See Your Partner as the Problem</h2>\n<p>A relationship is more successful when both partners see themselves as part of a team. When it starts to feel like one person is the problem and becomes &#8220;the enemy&#8221; it might be time to talk to a therapist.</p>\n<p>In this situation, your partner might not be pulling their weight within the team. However, they likely aren&#8217;t the whole problem. It&#8217;s important that both people see how their actions affect the relationship.</p>\n<p>Learning what you are accountable for can be scary, but it&#8217;s healthy!</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">couples therapist</a> is not just a third party who will tell your partner why they&#8217;re wrong. They are there to work with both of you, so you can get on the same side again.</p>\n<h2>7. You&#8217;re Committed to Your Marriage</h2>\n<p>Do the other 9 signs not apply to you and your partner? Being committed to your relationship is as good a sign as any that you can benefit from couples counseling.</p>\n<p>Your relationship doesn&#8217;t need to be in peril for you to talk to someone. Like a car, it&#8217;s helpful to do periodic maintenance so it runs better. Catching a problem early can mean avoiding a breakdown in the future.</p>\n<p>When times are good, a therapist can help you both improve your communication skills. That way, when you hit a rough patch, you&#8217;re prepared to deal with it in a more productive manner.</p>\n<h2>Do You Think You Might Need Couples Counseling?</h2>\n<p>These are 7 signs that you might benefit from couples counseling. But, if you&#8217;re thinking about whether you need it, you probably do! There&#8217;s no shame in it- everyone can benefit from an outside perspective.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",
