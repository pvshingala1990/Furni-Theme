Maybe one is working at home raising the kids, while the other is launching a startup. You are both so busy and exhausted that you may not have been physically intimate for weeks, even months.</p>\n<p>When couples can&#8217;t find time for romance, their relationships suffer. You may find you are fighting more frequently, talking less, and feeling resentful.</p>\n<p>How can you make time to be physically intimate when life gets really busy? Here are ten tips on how to salvage your sex life, and why it&#8217;s important.</p>\n<h3>1. Make a Date</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/scheduling-sex-could-save-your-relationship-but-theres-a-right-and-wrong-way-to-do-it\">Scheduling sex</a> may sound like a real buzzkill, but sometimes it is necessary to be as organized about this part of your life as you are about everything else.</p>\n<p>Just because you schedule some intimacy time, it does not mean it has to be boring or pedestrian. In fact, scheduling it gives you time to find that pretty lingerie in the back of your drawer, or jump in the shower after work.</p>\n<p>Show your partner that you are still as excited to be physically intimate with them as you were at the very beginning of the relationship.</p>\n<h3>2. Get a Babysitter</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard for new parents to leave a newborn to go out on the town. It&#8217;s hard to leave clinging toddlers, or school-age children clamoring for attention and help with homework.</p>\n<p>By the time you finish tending to the little ones, you probably aren&#8217;t feeling too keen on any physical intimacy.</p>\n<p>Get some help. Ask your mother or the neighborhood teenager to babysit for a few hours. You need to remember you are grownups and there is more to love than changing diapers.</p>\n<p>Book a motel room for a few hours, go park at a romantic lover&#8217;s lane! It&#8217;s worth the babysitting fees when you rekindle your passion for each other.</p>\n<h3>3. Go Away</h3>\n<p>Collapsing into the same bed every night, with texts pinging your phones and dogs and kids demanding attention&#8211;it&#8217;s not a recipe for exciting physical intimacy.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you need to get away from it all. Even if you are very busy, you need to make time for your loved one away from the distractions of day to day life.</p>\n<p>Maybe you can slip away to a mountain cabin out of cell phone range. Maybe you can afford to fly someplace warm, where you can swim in the ocean and remember how hot your partner looks in a bathing suit.</p>\n<h3>4. Talk About It</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-feel-more-comfortable-talking-about-sex-according-to-experts-12638086\">Talking about sex</a>&#8211;or the lack thereof&#8211;can be uncomfortable. The more uncomfortable you feel with your partner, the less likely you are to have sex with them. It becomes a vicious circle.</p>\n<p>Maybe your partner thinks you don&#8217;t feel attracted to her anymore. Maybe you think your partner is angry at you, when in fact he is just worried about something at work.</p>\n<p>If you do not open up about the issues affecting your romantic life, they can fester and get worse.</p>\n<h3>5. Get Couples Therapy</h3>\n<p>Many couples having challenges seek help from a therapist or counselor. Sometimes the presence of a third party professional enables honest communication in a way that you both may have forgotten.</p>\n<p>Not all therapy is expensive. There are effective <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">online programs for couples</a> seeking help in their relationships.</p>\n<h3>6. Try Massage</h3>\n<p>Reviving physical intimacy does not always have to involve actual sex. Sometimes couples need to become comfortable touching each other first.</p>\n<p>If you are overwhelmed and tense after a long day, ask your partner to massage your shoulders or your neck. Even a long, slow foot massage can prove relaxing and sensual.</p>\n<p>Focusing on each other and each other&#8217;s bodies can help bring you two together when outside life intervenes.</p>\n<h3>7. Watch a Sexy Movie</h3>\n<p>Anything is fine between consenting adults. In order to breathe new life in a relationship where the romance has taken a back seat, you may want to get a little adventurous.</p>\n<p>Watch something sexy on TV. Dress up. Visit an adult store and buy some novelties like toys or lotions.</p>\n<p>You may end up laughing, or loving it! No matter what, it can break down inhibitions and make life in the bedroom interesting again.</p>\n<h3>8. Look at Your Own Issues</h3>\n<p>Sometimes <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/individuals/\">one individual</a> in the relationship may need extra support. Before addressing the relationship issues, you may need to look into past traumas or issues which are currently affecting your present.</p>\n<p>Being in a long-term relationship can bring to light underlying issues out that we never knew where there. By working on your own challenges, you can clear away the troubles of the past and move forward in a healthy way.</p>\n<h3>9. Act Out a Fantasy</h3>\n<p>When real life gets busy, fantasy is a terrific outlet. Why not try a little role-playing with your partner?</p>\n<p>If you are sick and tired of giving orders every day at the office, why not play submissive with your mate, and let them give the commands? Or pretend to be two strangers who are having a spontaneous tryst. Anything that gets you out of the same old routine is sure to add some spice to your love life.</p>\n<h3>10. Learn to Say No&#8230;and Yes</h3>\n<p>If you are extremely busy with work, family and other obligations and it is hurting your relationship, you need to occasionally say no. Turn off the email. Turn down the invitation to the conference or that dinner party.</p>\n<p>Making your relationship a priority is essential to reviving physical intimacy and keeping love alive. You need to say &#8220;No&#8221; to the people demanding your time, and &#8220;Yes&#8221; to the most important person who truly deserves it.</p>\n<h3>Making Time to Be Physically Intimate: You&#8217;re Never Too Busy for Love</h3>\n<p>When you take time to be physically intimate in your relationship, you can improve trust and communication with your partner. By seeking help from professionals, you can find your way back from any distance that has grown since life became so busy.</p>\n<p>When you acknowledge that life has gotten in the way and you make affirmative steps to reconnect, you can both find fulfillment that extends beyond the physical.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

We get to flirt and go on adventures and get to know one another over the course of weeks or months or years.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that many of us already feel extremely close to our partner as we approach marriage, oftentimes we avoid some subjects because they&#8217;re uncomfortable, or because talking about them directly doesn&#8217;t come about naturally.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re on the verge of getting married, or you&#8217;ve only just begun to talk about the concept with your partner, there are some questions you&#8217;ve simply got to discuss with your partner when deciding whether or not marriage is the right choice for you.</p>\n<p>To see on a deeper level whether or not marriage is a good fit for you and your current partner, check out these 10 critical questions to ask before you get married.</p>\n<h2>1. Where Do We See Our Lives Going?</h2>\n<p>5 years, 10 years, 40 years down the line, where do you and your partner hope your lives will be?</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s right&#8211;we&#8217;re starting with a big one. If this answer to this question causes lots of disagreement or shows evidence of seriously-differing expectations from life, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/about/\">it&#8217;s important to take the time</a> to work through the answer to this question.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s natural for there to be some minor differences in expectation&#8211;but it&#8217;s important to discuss the areas in which one partner is unwilling to compromise, or where outlooks are at odds with the other&#8217;s.</p>\n<h2>2. What Are Our Thoughts on Children?</h2>\n<p>For many, this question may come up casually on a second or third date. For others, the question of intended family life can prove vastly more complicated and stressful.</p>\n<p>Be honest with your partner&#8211;do you hope to carry children? Do you want to adopt? Do you have little or no interest in building a family of your own?</p>\n<p>Rarely do <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/individuals/\">individuals&#8217; desire</a> for a family or lack thereof change after entering marriage. Understand what to expect from your partner from the beginning, and do your best to be on the same page.</p>\n<h2>3. How Do We Handle Stress?</h2>\n<p>The answer to this question may come about naturally over the course of the relationship. You&#8217;ll witness your partner when they&#8217;re stuck in traffic. You&#8217;ll see how they handle stress from work.</p>\n<p>But taking the time to understand how stress affects your relationship and might have an impact later on is extremely important.</p>\n<p>Remember that, in the decades you&#8217;ll spend together, plenty of pressure and stress will come along. Don&#8217;t let you or your partner be blindsided by the ways in which the other handles stress.</p>\n<h2>4. How Do We Handle Conflict?</h2>\n<p>In a similar vein, you may start to notice the ways in which your partner handles conflict as your relationship grows. This could be any sort of conflict-relevant to your relationship or not.</p>\n<p>Are your arguments healthy? Are your tense conversations safe and productive? Has anyone ever been physically injured in an argument? Has anyone felt a lasting emotional impact from a conflict?</p>\n<h2>5. What Are Our Relationships with Gambling, Drugs, and Alcohol?</h2>\n<p>While many people throughout the world have a healthy, social relationship to things like gambling, drugs, and alcohol, an attachment to any of these things that are over-the-top or begins affecting either partner more deeply can prove detrimental to a relationship.</p>\n<p>Signs of addiction are often easy to ignore or shrug off&#8211;but before you commit your life to another person, it&#8217;s imperative to address these problems, no matter how uncomfortable the conversation may seem.</p>\n<h2>6. How Will We Manage Finances?</h2>\n<p>Money issues are <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/04/money-is-the-leading-cause-of-stress-in-relationships.html\">one of the leading causes of strain</a> on modern marriage. While many couples, even those in serious relationships, maintain separate finances, marriage could likely change this fact, and it&#8217;s important to understand how.</p>\n<p>Money is connected to our sense of security and overall well being. It&#8217;s important to be open, clear, and honest when it comes to finances in order to pave a comfortable and sensible road for finances in your marriage.</p>\n<h2>7. What Would Happen If We Experienced a Change in Work Life?</h2>\n<p>Layoffs, promotions, and burnouts happen to each of us at some point in our work life. It&#8217;s necessary to understand the ways in which one another is connected to their job before entering into marriage.</p>\n<p>Nothing with work life is ever certain, but understanding things like whether either partner would be willing to relocate for the other&#8217;s career aspirations, or whether one partner&#8217;s salary is the one on which you depend most heavily can be crucial to your marriage. Be open and honest with one another about work life at all times.</p>\n<h2>8. Do We Expect Change from the Other After Marriage?</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s never a good idea to enter into marriage aware of a problem, but expecting a change in the other person that&#8217;ll solve it. If there&#8217;s something you&#8217;ve wished your partner would work on, tell them. If there&#8217;s a problem present in your marriage, work on it.</p>\n<p>In a perfect world, marriage and other life changes would be just what we needed to fix those longstanding problems. In reality, they&#8217;re usually not. If you&#8217;re expecting a change from your partner, communicate it. Don&#8217;t expect it to be brought on by marriage.</p>\n<h2>9. Are We Both Satisfied with Our Sex Life?</h2>\n<p>Although sex should always be had in order to express physical affection and to boost an otherwise-good relationship, people oftentimes find themselves in situations where sex is masking other problems&#8211;or where the <a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/dating/sex/less-sex-in-relationship-meaning/2015215\">sex itself becomes a problem</a>.</p>\n<p>Be clear about your feelings toward your sex life. Is one partner more adventurous than the other? Does one have a consistently higher sex drive? Do we enjoy our time being intimate with one another?</p>\n<h2>10. How Important Is Upkeep of Physical Appearance?</h2>\n<p>Going forward from marriage, some things will change. For some couples, a major change in physical appearance comes when one partner begins to be more relaxed at times, without always striving to look their best.</p>\n<p>An important aspect of marriage is understanding that your relationship is built on love, not on the physical and superficial elements of a relationship. Ensure that you and your partner feel the same with regards to one another&#8217;s physical appearance&#8211;and remember that love should always come first.</p>\n<h2>Want More Questions to Ask Before You Get Married?</h2>\n<p>Marriage vows are one of the deepest, most all-encompassing commitments you can make to another person. In order to ensure you&#8217;ll have a long, healthy, and happy relationship with your partner throughout your marriage, you&#8217;ll need to be open and honest with each other&#8211;even if it means asking the tough questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Are you experiencing problems in your relationship but don&#8217;t want to break up?</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry, your relationship isn&#8217;t doomed. Rather, you&#8217;re going through a rough patch in your relationship. And this is perfectly normal.</p>\n<p>When the honeymoon phase is over, getting to <strong>REALLY</strong> know each other is difficult for all couples. And no one is perfect.</p>\n<p>This is why it&#8217;s best to try and work things out before calling the whole relationship quits. Fortunately, there&#8217;s a way you can work through any problem.</p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s still hope in your relationship, here are 9 tips to get through a rough patch in a relationship.</p>\n<h2>1. Try and Spend More Time Together</h2>\n<p>Oftentimes, relationships struggle because you and your partner don&#8217;t spend enough time together. And it&#8217;s understandable why.</p>\n<p>Many couples have conflicting work schedules or life happens. Long distance relationships are also on the rise, which is always a struggle.</p>\n<p>Try to make time for each other as much as possible. Plan a date or just plan a Netflix night once a week.</p>\n<h2>2. Identify Bad Behavior</h2>\n<p>A relationship can either bring out the best or the worst in us. Do you notice you&#8217;re always in a crabby mood when you&#8217;re with your partner? Or do you notice your partner is progressively becoming more depressed or negative?</p>\n<p>Your partner should bring out the best in you. But if the opposite is happening, reflect back on your or your partner&#8217;s behavior and try to identify the culprit. Who knows &#8211; it may not have anything to do with the relationship.</p>\n<h2>3. Hold Onto Trust</h2>\n<p>Trust is the foundation for every relationship. Even during the bad times, you should always hold on to trust.</p>\n<p>Trust can be anything. Trust can mean you know all of your problems will work out. Trust can also mean your partner will never go behind your back, even during the tough times.</p>\n<p>Even if you two are fighting or if the spark is fading, trust will always bring you two back together.</p>\n<h2>4. Remember the Good Times</h2>\n<p>During the bad times, it&#8217;s always easy to be negative and feel resentment toward your partner. But you get what you put out into the universe.</p>\n<p>If you want the relationship to work out, start feeling more positive. The easiest way to do this is by remembering the good times.</p>\n<p>The good times can mean anything.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was a special day, like your first date or a wedding day. It can also be a combination of the times your partner made you smile and laugh. Even focusing on what you love about your partner can also bring positivity.</p>\n<h2>5. Never Stop Loving Them</h2>\n<p>Love is unconditional. That means your love is strong during the good times&#8230;and the bad. Even during this difficult time, never stop loving them.</p>\n<p>But this is easier said than done. You could be mad at your partner or feeling negatively toward them. In order for the relationship to work, the flame can&#8217;t go out. And this isn&#8217;t easy when you&#8217;re going through a rough patch.</p>\n<p>Little things <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/stronger-the-broken-places/201505/13-ways-keep-love-alive\">keep love alive</a>, such as &#8220;good morning&#8221; and &#8220;goodnight&#8221; text messages. Remember back to a time when your love was the deepest. Repeat this time by going out on little dates or doing things you did back then.</p>\n<h2>6. Listen</h2>\n<p>Talking is easy in a relationship. You have a lot of things on your mind and you can&#8217;t way to spill it all out on your partner. But this may not be as beneficial as you think.</p>\n<p>Instead of opening your mouth, open your ears. Let your partner talk first. You&#8217;ll be surprised how effective this can be; who knows, maybe your partner already knows the solutions to your problems.</p>\n<h2>7. Keep the Attraction Alive</h2>\n<p>During the bad times, the last thing you may think about is sex. But you&#8217;ll be shocked at how many problems sex can solve.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.boldsky.com/relationship/love-and-romance/2014/twenty-reasons-why-physical-intimacy-is-important-046481.html\">Intimacy is important</a> in any relationship. Sex and attraction are what truly helps you two connect. Sex also boosts feel-good neurotransmitters that can put you two in a happier mood.</p>\n<p>Are you still uncomfortable with sex during this time? You can still do little things to fire that spark. Wear sexy outfits around the house. Kiss and hold each other more. Any physical intimacy will re-ignite that spark.</p>\n<h2>8. Ask Advice From Family and Friends</h2>\n<p>No one knows you and your relationship better than your family and friends. That&#8217;s why they will have a thing or two to say about the situation. Who knows, they have probably been through a similar situation.</p>\n<p>Ask their advice. They may have something valuable to say. They can also help describe why you feel a certain way. And some people would rather be a sounding board so you can share your hurt and anger.</p>\n<h2>9. You Both Have to Make It Work</h2>\n<p>Even if the love is still there, the relationship won&#8217;t work unless both of you are willing to make it work. If <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/individuals/\">one person</a> is putting their all into the relationship, it will inevitably fail.</p>\n<p>What does this mean? You both have to agree that you&#8217;ll do what you can to improve the relationship. You both also have to agree that the both of you want this relationship to work.</p>\n<p>This also means if your partner is too discouraged or lazy to work on the relationship, you need to pull the plug.</p>\n<h2>You Can Repair a Rough Patch in a Relationship</h2>\n<p>Suffering through a rough patch in a relationship is difficult for any couple. But just remember that no relationship is perfect. As long as there&#8217;s love and a will to make it work, you and your partner can overcome any relationship issues.</p>\n<p>Use these tips and give it some time. Just try and be positive. You and your partner will work things out.</p>\n<p>Another great way to repair your relationship is through couples counseling.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

Sometimes, problems arise in our marriages that we can&#8217;t just &#8220;get over&#8221; because we love each other.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, we need a helping hand.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/7-signs-you-and-your-partner-could-benefit-from-couples-counseling/\">Couples counseling</a> can give you and your spouse a safe place to work through your conflict with a third party.</p>\n<p>But convincing your spouse to see a counselor with you can be a minefield. If you&#8217;re not careful, the therapy talk could cause another huge argument.</p>\n<h2>Be Honest About Your Struggles</h2>\n<p>Open and honest communication is an important part of any healthy marriage.</p>\n<p>But so is choosing your battles. Sometimes, we try to convince ourselves that certain things aren&#8217;t big deals. We don&#8217;t want to start a fight or look like we&#8217;re irrational, so we let it slide.</p>\n<p>But sometimes, those things tend to build up and cause huge blocks in communication. We go months without telling them what&#8217;s wrong because we feel like it&#8217;s been too long for it to matter.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re worried that if we suggest therapy, our spouse will feel like we aren&#8217;t happy with them anymore.</p>\n<p>More often than not though, your spouse knows that your marriage is not ideal. Being honest about your struggles can help open the door to healing.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t Play the Blame Game</h2>\n<p>&#8220;It takes two to tango,&#8221; as the saying goes. In most struggling marriages, there are no innocent parties.</p>\n<p>Nobody&#8217;s perfect. And for the most part, if your marriage is on the rocks, both of you contributed to that situation.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t come into the therapy talk with finger-pointing and blaming. Tell your spouse that you don&#8217;t care whose fault it is. You just want to get better.</p>\n<p>Chances are, they want to help your marriage too. Keeping blame out of it will keep them from getting defensive.</p>\n<h2>Let Them Know You Love Them</h2>\n<p>When you tell your spouse that you want to go to have therapy talk, they might think it&#8217;s because you don&#8217;t love them anymore.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a common association to make. Many couples only try marriage counseling when <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/divorce-grownups/200904/marriage-counseling-and-the-decision-divorce\">one of them wants a divorce</a>.</p>\n<p>Affirm your feelings with your spouse. Let them know that you want to see a counselor because you love them, not because you don&#8217;t.</p>\n<h2>Move Past the Stigma</h2>\n<p>For all of its benefits, &#8220;counseling&#8221; is still a dirty word to a lot of people.</p>\n<p>Some people think that if they see a counselor, it means there&#8217;s something wrong with them. Similarly, if they need a marriage counselor, there&#8217;s something wrong with their marriage.</p>\n<p>But a marriage counselor can be a preventative measure too. They can help give you the tools to offer <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/test/\">emotional support</a> to your spouse so you can avoid bigger problems later on.</p>\n<p>Tell your spouse of strong couples you may know who went to marriage counseling. Help them see that it&#8217;s not just for broken marriages.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t Get Defensive When They Get Defensive</h2>\n<p>When you mention counseling to your spouse, they may get defensive.</p>\n<p>This is normal. They might feel like you&#8217;re trying to blame them for not having a good marriage. They may be projecting experiences from the failed marriages they&#8217;ve seen around them onto you.</p>\n<p>As much as you want to defend yourself from their accusations, don&#8217;t do it.</p>\n<p>Getting defensive back at them can exacerbate communication problems and escalate the conflict unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>Stay calm, and keep things from getting heated.</p>\n<h2>Be Clear With Your Motives</h2>\n<p>Some people feel like the only way they can get their spouse to counseling is to trick them. They might say they&#8217;re going to meet with friends, only to ambush them in a counselor&#8217;s office.</p>\n<p>As desperate as things get, DO NOT do that.</p>\n<p>If there are any underlying trust issues in the relationship, that will only make it worse.</p>\n<h2>Set Clear Goals</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest reasons people quit therapy is because they don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://themighty.com/2017/06/should-i-stop-therapy/\">accomplishing anything</a>.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re still fighting about the same issues &#8211; what&#8217;s the point? Why are we wasting all this money?</p>\n<p>Progress is not linear. Especially when you&#8217;re dealing with therapy.</p>\n<p>Marriage counseling is not a cure-all to fix your marriage instantly. It&#8217;s a way to get the tools you need to work through conflicts together.</p>\n<p>But knowing that doesn&#8217;t always help us from feeling like counseling is ineffective.</p>\n<p>Set clear goals with your spouse of what you want out of counseling. Decide on some metrics and benchmarks that you can point out to prove that things are getting better.</p>\n<p>It might be days without a fight, durations of fights, frequency of <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/how-to-stay-physically-intimate-when-your-life-gets-busy/\">physical intimacy</a>, or any other metric you choose.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s important to set these goals with your spouse.</p>\n<h2>Choose A Counselor Together</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s not unusual for one spouse to want to see a counselor before the other.</p>\n<p>But this can create a dynamic with the reluctant spouse that they&#8217;re just doing &#8220;whatever you want, dear.&#8221; They&#8217;re just going along with it.</p>\n<p>Give your spouse as much agency in the process as you can-especially when choosing a counselor.</p>\n<p>If you choose a counselor on your own, it could feel like you and your counselor are ganging up on your spouse.</p>\n<h2>Let Them Make the Decision For Themselves</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s an old saying about horses and water and making them drink.</p>\n<p>If your spouse is reluctant to go to counseling, they might agree to go to appease you. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that they actually have any interest in examining the relationship themselves.</p>\n<p>No matter how much you want to go to couples counseling, make sure to communicate with your spouse that they don&#8217;t have to do it. And not in a manipulative way, either.</p>\n<p>Let them make their own decision. It&#8217;s much better to see a counselor later than you wanted when they are more cooperative than to get a stubborn spouse there as soon as you suggest it.</p>\n<h2>Having the Therapy Talk</h2>\n<p>Suggesting marriage counseling to your spouse can be an intimidating ordeal. This is especially true if you don&#8217;t know how they will respond-or maybe even if you know exactly how they&#8217;ll respond.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t let that fear stop you from making the right move for your marriage.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

Are you and your significant having trouble communicating or trusting each other?</p>\n<p>Before you throw in the towel, try to repair your relationship back to its healthy state. Studies show that couples therapy is effective at restoring a relationship <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/in-it-together/201712/couples-therapy-does-it-really-work\">75 percent</a> of the time.</p>\n<p>Going into your first session of couples counseling can feel intimidating at first. Here&#8217;s what to expect in couples therapy and how it actually works.</p>\n<h2>Reveal Basic Information About the Relationship</h2>\n<p>Wondering what to expect from couples counseling? The first session is spent learning more about each individual person and your relationship as a couple.</p>\n<p>Is important that your therapist or counselor gets to know each of you on a personal level. They can ask about everything from your childhood to how you met each other.</p>\n<p>While these facts may seem insignificant to you, they are important to understanding your whole story.</p>\n<p>Many people get discouraged after the first session is just a bunch of questions and there&#8217;s not a lot of actual therapy happening. Don&#8217;t worry, this is just so your therapist or counselor can get to know each of you.</p>\n<p>As your sessions continue, they will be more of what you expect.</p>\n<h2>Get to the Root of The Problems</h2>\n<p>There can be <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/7-signs-you-and-your-partner-could-benefit-from-couples-counseling/\">many different reasons</a> why you are trying couples counseling.</p>\n<p>Some of the most common reasons include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having the same arguments over and over</li>\n<li>Never fighting and ignoring the problems</li>\n<li>Physical intimacy problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not everyone&#8217;s problems will look the same, but identifying your specific problems is an important step.</p>\n<p>You may go into therapy thinking that your problem is all based on intimacy. But your therapist could soon discover that your relationship lacks trust and communication.</p>\n<p>As you share your concerns, your therapist will look for underlying, connecting themes.</p>\n<h2>Develop Goals and a Timeline</h2>\n<p>By pinpointing the root of your relationship problems, you can then develop your goals for therapy.</p>\n<p>Every couple&#8217;s goals will look different. Maybe you want to fall in love again or understand each other better. Some of your goals can focus on specific skills or just getting through a large adjustment together, such as a job change.</p>\n<p>A certain percentage of couples may decide that their goal is to end the relationship on a good note. Therapy can help you realize that your relationship is beyond saving and learn how to let go of it healthily.</p>\n<p>Remember that your goals can evolve over the course of your therapy. So your initial goal won&#8217;t necessarily be your end goal.</p>\n<p>Once you lay out your goals for therapy, you and your therapist will develop a timeline. This will happen once you already go through a few sessions and they get a better idea of where your relationship stands.</p>\n<p>Some couples only need a few months of therapy. Other couples may consider therapy a new part of their relationship.</p>\n<h2>Learn New Skills to Improve Relationship</h2>\n<p>What happens in marriage counseling? The most important aspect of marriage counseling is learning new skills that&#8217;ll benefit your relationship beyond the counseling sessions.</p>\n<p>Some of the most important skills in a relationship include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.marriage.com/advice/relationship/effective-relationship-communication-skills/\">Communication skills</a></li>\n<li>Patience and forgiveness</li>\n<li>Trust and honesty</li>\n<li>Selflessness</li>\n<li>Stress-management</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most couples have had all the essential skills at some point in their relationship but have just forgotten how to use them. Your therapy sessions will remind you of the importance of these skills and show you how they can improve your relationship.</p>\n<h2>Homework Outside of Sessions</h2>\n<p>Working on your relationship doesn&#8217;t stop once your therapy session ends. In fact, a major part of couples therapy is what happens in between the sessions.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll have tasks, or homework, to complete between each session. It&#8217;s important that you take your lessons seriously and complete these tasks if you want the counseling to work.</p>\n<p>Some of these homework assignments could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go out on a date without your phones.</li>\n<li>Get intimate with your partner.</li>\n<li>Keep a log of your emotions and any arguments that arise.</li>\n<li>Read a self-help book together and hold discussions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ultimate goal of this homework is to get you to a point where you can work out your issues on your own outside of therapy. You&#8217;ll start small with a few tasks but eventually, you&#8217;ll be able to tackle any issue that arises.</p>\n<h2>Attend Both Couple and Individual Sessions</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re still wondering what is couples therapy like, you may be surprised that it won&#8217;t always be as a couple.</p>\n<p>While couples sessions are the basis of the therapy, there are some things you need to work on by yourself. Often times, one of you has skills that the other needs to brush up on.</p>\n<p>Or one of you needs one-on-one time to work out trust issues from their past.</p>\n<p>Individual sessions are a possibility, but no couples therapy is successful with merely individual sessions. In order to be successful, you need to make sure both you and your significant other are committed to the sessions.</p>\n<h2>Beyond What to Expect in Couples Therapy</h2>\n<p>Now that you know what to expect in couples therapy, it&#8217;s time to improve your relationship. There&#8217;s no time like the present and you have nothing to lose.</p>\n<p>Want to start therapy but have limited time?

Even though you&#8217;re devastated by it, you&#8217;re ready to give them a second a chance.</p>\n<p>But, you&#8217;re worried that you won&#8217;t be able to trust after cheating. Trust is the foundation to a healthy relationship, so what do you do when that foundation has been destroyed?</p>\n<p>You need to work as hard as you can to build that trust back up. How do you do that, exactly? It definitely won&#8217;t be easy. But, it is possible.</p>\n<p>In fact, according to recent studies, about <a href=\"https://www.divorcemag.com/articles/frequently-asked-questions-about-infidelity/\">60 to 75 percent of couples</a> stay together after infidelity. But, you don&#8217;t just want to stick out for the sake of sticking it out. You want your relationship to be the loving and trusting one it once was.</p>\n<p>How do you do this?</p>\n<p>Read on to learn how to regain trust after cheating.</p>\n<h2>1. Let Yourself Be Raw With Your Emotions</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, when someone is cheated on, they try to keep their emotions bottled inside of them, thinking that this is somehow &#8220;taking the high road&#8221;.</p>\n<p>While we certainly don&#8217;t condone screaming at your partner on the top of your lungs, it is important to wear your heart on your sleeve and make sure your partner knows exactly how you&#8217;re feeling about them cheating. Don&#8217;t be afraid to cry, grieve, and talk about your pain with your partner.</p>\n<p>Letting yourself be <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/150219-7-ways-to-let-yourself-become-more-vulnerable\">100 percent emotionally vulnerable</a> in front of your partner can help you break down communication barriers in your relationship.</p>\n<h2>2. Don&#8217;t Ignore What Happened</h2>\n<p>One thing that&#8217;s even worse than holding in your emotions is to ignore the issue completely.</p>\n<p>If you do this, there will constantly be an elephant in the room and you will never be able to rebuild your trust. And, you will never get down to the bottom of the underlying issue in your relationship.</p>\n<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t to say that you&#8217;re at fault for your partner cheating. However, there may be an issue that, if you addressed it, would make your relationship a million times stronger.</p>\n<p>Also, getting to the underlying issue can help you decide whether your partner is worth sticking with or not. For example, if they say the reason they cheated was because of something you did, and they try to shift the blame onto you entirely, it may not be worth fighting for your relationship.</p>\n<h2>3. Don&#8217;t Be a Helicopter Partner</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve all heard of helicopter parents. But, partners can be helicopters as well.</p>\n<p>Many couples make the mistake of thinking that building trust means watching your partner&#8217;s every move. As tempting as it can be to do this, this will actually end up destroying trust in the long run.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re checking your partner&#8217;s texts and emails, checking in with them a million times a day, tracking them on their phone, or engaging in any other behavior that involves keeping a close eye on them, you aren&#8217;t building trust. All you are doing is giving them a constant reminder that you, in fact, don&#8217;t trust them.</p>\n<h2>4. Stay Present and Future-Oriented</h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;ve been cheated on, it can be easy to fall into a routine of constantly living in the past, dwelling on the incident and pitying yourself because of what happened.</p>\n<p>But, this is not how you build trust after cheating. In order to build trust again, you need to make your best effort to focus on the present and future. Rather than focusing on what you or your partner could have done to prevent cheating, focus on what you can do now and in the future to make your relationship stronger.</p>\n<h2>5. Go to Counseling</h2>\n<p>One very practical solution to rebuilding trust in your relationship is to go to counseling.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, all it takes is an impartial third party to help you figure out how to get your relationship back on track. While talking to friends or family can be helpful, oftentimes, they end up being a negative influence. This is because they love you and hate to see you get hurt. Therefore, they have personal biases that will cloud their advice on the situation.</p>\n<p>Plus, sometimes it just helps to have your feelings heard by someone who isn&#8217;t your partner. Many couples who have happy, healthy relationships go to counseling too. There&#8217;s no reason to feel embarrassed about seeing a professional.</p>\n<h2>6. Trust Yourself</h2>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t trust yourself, you are never going to be able to trust your partner.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, the partner who was cheated on starts developing doubts about themselves. If you find you&#8217;ve been asking yourself questions like, &#8220;Should I have done something different?&#8221; or, &#8220;Should I have seen this coming?&#8221;, then you need to take a step back.</p>\n<p>Remind yourself that you&#8217;re smart, you can trust your own feelings, and that you&#8217;ll be okay moving forward. Also, it&#8217;s important to remind yourself that if your partner cheated again, you could survive it.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s only when you have full trust in yourself that you can have full trust in your partner.</p>\n<h2>7. Communicate About Communication</h2>\n<p>In a lot of cases, couples who have been through cheating had communication issues before the cheating happened.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t to say poor communication is an excuse to cheat, but excellent communication can help <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/about/\">strengthen your relationship</a>. While there&#8217;s a lot of argument out there about why cheating occurs, usually it has to do with one partner feeling like their needs weren&#8217;t being met.</p>\n<p>So, when talking about the cheating incident, address why there was a communication problem and what both you and your partner are going to do to solve it. Sometimes, saying something as simple as, &#8220;You can always tell me when something about our relationship is bothering you,&#8221; is enough to strengthen your communication.</p>\n<h2>Trust After Cheating: Time to Build It Back Up</h2>\n<p>Building trust after cheating is a lot of work, but it can be done if you follow the tips outlined in this article.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

But there is something even harder than breaking up. That is knowing when to break up.</p>\n<p>It is understandably difficult to admit to yourself when it is over. This is someone with whom you have spent a significant chunk of your life.</p>\n<p>There is not just the relationship itself. There is all of the effort and time the relationship represents. All of these things give more motivation to stick in something that is not working than to end it.</p>\n<p>How can you approach this decision with clear eyes? What are the signs your relationship is over? You do not want to do this lightly, so the signs better have weight.</p>\n<p>We have found five signs we believe are among the best indicators that your relationship is over. Read on, and see if you can use them to diagnose your own relationship troubles as temporary or terminal.</p>\n<h2>5 Clear Signs Your Relationship Is Over</h2>\n<p>Before we begin, a couple disclaimers.</p>\n<p>You will not see &#8220;a lack of communication&#8221; on this list. Communication underlies almost every aspect of a romantic relationship, and we all know this. We do not think it is necessary to waste your time telling you something you already know.</p>\n<p>You will see communication difficulties on this list, but we have made them as specific and identifiable as possible.</p>\n<p>Also, please know this about a failing relationship. Just because it has soured does not mean it is spoiled.</p>\n<p>You still have the benefits of all the time and energy you put into your relationship. We do not just mean the memories. You have grown from this relationship, no matter how bad it feels now, and it is important that you honor your own experience and growth.</p>\n<p>If, after seeing these signs, you decide that your relationship is over, do not consider it a failure. Just because something expires does not make it worthless.</p>\n<p>Now that we have gotten that out of the way, see below the signs for yourself. It is time to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/faq/\">answer your questions</a> about unhealthy relationships.</p>\n<h3>1. You Have Stopped Making Plans for the Future</h3>\n<p>There is a lot of talk about how much work it takes to be in a relationship. There is truth to this, but it is also overblown.</p>\n<p>Your relationship should be a joy. You should take interest in your partner&#8217;s interests and see them as the infinitely complex person they are. There is always more to discover about another person with whom you are intimate, and you should jump at the chance to discover all you can about them.</p>\n<p>Shared experiences are one of the ways couples get to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/the-importance-of-sharing-experiences/381493/\">know each other more deeply</a>. These experiences do not have to be epic. They can be as simple as exploring new areas of your city together.</p>\n<p>If you and your partner have stopped planning these kinds of experiences, that is a big red flag. It is likely that one or both of you find it difficult or uncomfortable spending too much time together.</p>\n<p>If you do not work through that difficulty and discomfort, it only grows. If you avoid future plans, it is time to take a look at what is wrong in the present.</p>\n<h3>2. You No Longer Argue</h3>\n<p>Fighting all the time is awful. Never fighting might be even worse.</p>\n<p>There is a kind of passivity that can settle into a relationship, especially in cohabitation. When you live with someone, it is important to pick the issues that are most important to you. Dishes, for example, are rarely the hill to die on.</p>\n<p>That said, neither of you should be so agreeable as to erase your personality. This breeds unfamiliarity, and unfamiliarity breeds contempt.</p>\n<p>When you spend all of your time pretending everything is fine, you lose the authenticity that feeds a healthy relationship.</p>\n<h3>3. Death by a Thousand Cuts</h3>\n<p>This is another bad model for disagreements. Big fights can be healthy for a relationship. They help partners clarify their values and express their love for each other, if they argue productively.</p>\n<p>Unproductive arguments are those that occur over tiny infractions. When pet peeves start to pile up, it is easy to look for any excuse to get into an argument. You may not even recognize you are doing it.</p>\n<p>If this is happening constantly, you may want to evaluate the underlying issues. Are the socks on the floor the real problem, or do you feel disrespected? If the latter, why do you feel uncomfortable addressing that?</p>\n<h3>4. Boredom Has Set in</h3>\n<p>The opposite of love is not hate. It is boredom. At least love and hate are strong feelings.</p>\n<p>Boredom, on the other hand, means you do not even care enough to think about the other person. This ties into making future plans. If you do not have the interest even to schedule dates, why are you two dating?</p>\n<h3>5. You Can&#8217;t Remember the Last Time You Touched</h3>\n<p>The loss of physical affection is one of the clearest outward signs that something is wrong in a relationship.</p>\n<p>This does not just mean sex, although a dip in the amount of sex you are having is certainly not a good thing. But it can be simpler and subtler than that.</p>\n<p>A relationship should be full of small physical gestures. Kisses, holding hands, gentle touches on the arm, leg, and back are all signs of care. If these start to go, it&#8217;s a sign something deeper has faded as well.</p>\n<h2>What to Do When the Damage Isn&#8217;t Done</h2>\n<p>Ending a relationship can be a traumatic experience, but it can be a productive trauma from which it is possible to rebuild. If it needs to be done, it is best to start that rebuilding process as soon as possible. Hopefully, reading these signs your relationship is over have helped you assess your own situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

There are many ways an individual can be unfaithful, though, including emotional cheating.</p>\n<p>Emotional cheating is highly common. In fact, the results of one study showed that <a href=\"https://www.fatherly.com/health-science/emotional-affair/\">78.6 percent</a> of men and 91.6 percent of women had admitted to an emotional affair at some point in their relationship.</p>\n<p>Is there a possibility that your partner is cheating emotionally? Are you unsure of the signs or how to address the issue without sacrificing your relationship?</p>\n<p>Read on to learn more about emotional cheating and how to handle it in your relationship.</p>\n<h2>What is Emotional Cheating?</h2>\n<p>In order to understand emotional cheating, it&#8217;s important to first understand the difference between emotional and physical affairs. There are some key differences between the two, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical affairs involve a partner engaging in sexual intimacy with another person.</li>\n<li>Emotional affairs often do not involve physical intimacy. Sometimes, the two people never meet in-person.</li>\n<li>Emotional affairs involve sharing intimate thoughts and feelings, often thoughts and feelings that are not shared with the person&#8217;s partner or spouse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Essentially, during an emotional affair, one person develops intimate feelings for someone besides their partner or spouse. They may even fall in love with that person.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that both physical and emotional affairs are devastating to a relationship. In many cases, though, people report feeling <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5864149/Is-emotional-affair-worse-physical-one-relationship-expert-weighs-in.html\">more upset</a> by an emotional affair than a physical one.</p>\n<h2>Characteristics of an Emotional Affair</h2>\n<p>How do you determine whether your partner is actually having an emotional affair or has just struck up a strong friendship with another person? Are you being paranoid, or are they actually engaged in emotional cheating?</p>\n<p>There are three characteristics that define emotional cheating:</p>\n<h3>Secrecy</h3>\n<p>If an individual is engaged in an emotional affair, they will likely keep their relationship with the other person a secret. They might delete texts or emails or hide their phone from their partner.</p>\n<h3>Deceipt</h3>\n<p>Deceipt involves intentionally deceiving one&#8217;s partner to prevent them from learning about the emotional affair. Lying about where you&#8217;ve been, where you&#8217;re going, or whom you&#8217;re speaking to is common during an emotional affair.</p>\n<h3>Betrayal</h3>\n<p>Betrayal occurs when you begin to do things with someone else that you wouldn&#8217;t do with your partner.</p>\n<p>This might mean sharing information or important stories that you&#8217;ve never told your partner or engaging in activities you&#8217;ve never engaged in with your partner.</p>\n<h2>Signs Your Partner is Cheating Emotionally</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, emotional cheating can be harder to spot than physical cheating. The individual involved in the affair may be fully present physically.</p>\n<p>On the surface, everything might seem fine. Your partner is returning from work on time, participating in family activities, and seems generally happy. But, they might also be presenting some questionable behaviors you might not have noticed.</p>\n<p>The following are some common signs of emotional cheating that you ought to look out for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spending more time than usual on their phone or computer</li>\n<li>Working more than usual</li>\n<li>Developing a new love for social media</li>\n<li>Asking for more space or alone time</li>\n<li>Asking questions about the relationship ending, especially during fights or arguments</li>\n<li>Getting defensive or evasive when asked about their relationship with another person</li>\n<li>Constantly talking about a new friend or coworker</li>\n<li>Changing their appearance or style</li>\n<li>Being overly critical about the other partner&#8217;s appearance or behavior</li>\n<li>Projecting their insecurities and accusing the other partner of cheating</li>\n<li>Changes in sexual intimacy</li>\n<li>Turning to someone else after a hard day or difficult event</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, one or two of these signs aren&#8217;t necessarily a guarantee that your partner is engaged in an emotional affair. But, if you notice several of these signs, they may be pointing to something more serious.</p>\n<h2>What to do About Emotional Cheating</h2>\n<p>If you find that your partner is engaged in an emotional affair, it&#8217;s easy to feel overwhelmed and unsure of what to do.</p>\n<p>Do you bring it up? Do you pretend it&#8217;s not happening? Do you need to end the relationship?</p>\n<p>Everyone handles these kinds of issues differently. But, the following steps can help you take control of the situation:</p>\n<h3>How to Confront Your Partner</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s normal to feel angry or want to confront your partner in a dramatic way after you learn about an emotional affair. That&#8217;s typically not the best approach, though.</p>\n<p>Give yourself a day or two to let your emotions settle. Then, set aside time to speak to your partner privately.</p>\n<p>During the conversation, focus on your feelings and use &#8220;I&#8221; language so your partner doesn&#8217;t feel attacked or a need to get defensive.</p>\n<h3>Repairing Your Relationship</h3>\n<p>After talking to your partner, you&#8217;ll need to decide where you want to go from here. Do you want to continue the relationship, or do you want to part ways?</p>\n<p>If you do decide that you want to save the relationship, consider working with a couples therapist.</p>\n<p>Whether you <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/about/\">see a therapist online</a> or in-person, they can help you identify the issues that led to the affair and strengthen your relationship.</p>\n<h3>How to Protect Your Relationship Against Future Cheating</h3>\n<p>If you do decide to seek counseling to repair your relationship, remember that it&#8217;s also important to protect it against future cheating (emotional or otherwise). Some steps you can take to do this include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work on building shared friendships and interests</li>\n<li>Work on improving your communication skills</li>\n<li>Return to the beginning of your relationship and remember why you fell in love in the first place</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These aren&#8217;t the only safeguards against emotional cheating, of course. But, they&#8217;re a good starting point.</p>\n<h2>Get Help with Your Relationship Today</h2>\n<p>Do you suspect your partner of emotional cheating? Have you noticed signs of an emotional affair?</p>\n<p>If this is going on in your relationship, it can be hard to know where to turn to get the help you need. In many cases, though, couples counseling is the first step to repairing your relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

You can probably hear Ross&#8217;s voice ringing through your head now!</p>\n<p>But in reality, taking a break from a relationship is no joking matter. In fact, many people feel they don&#8217;t work and lead to an actual break up.</p>\n<p>Yet, that&#8217;s not true.</p>\n<p>There are ways of taking a break that can lead to the kind of clarity and understanding a troubled relationship needs to survive. Let&#8217;s look into the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of pausing your relationship.</p>\n<h2>Do: Be Honest About Why</h2>\n<p>Before deciding to put your relationship on pause, it&#8217;s important to understand why you feel this way.</p>\n<p>You may have reached an impasse in the relationship and need to take a step back to refocus. Or a potential deal-breaker has come up and you need time to think.</p>\n<p>Whatever you identify the issue to be, that&#8217;s the time to set down <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">with your partner</a> and talk it through. Be open and honest with them. And listen to what they have to say.</p>\n<p>Above all, don&#8217;t request a break in the middle of anger or frustration. It&#8217;s a big decision to make. And one that both of you need to discuss and decide on together.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t: Take a Break If You Want to Break up</h2>\n<p>Many people decide to take a relationship break to avoid the messy situation of actually breaking up. But taking this slow-motion approach will only be harder on the both of you.</p>\n<p>If you know you want to break up, it&#8217;s best to confront the situation head-on.</p>\n<p>It may suck to think about hurting your partner. And the thought of being alone again is scary. But taking a break will only prolong the inevitable.</p>\n<p>Breaking up now, when you know it&#8217;s what you want, will let the healing process begin. Not only for yourself but your partner as well. And you both deserve that much.</p>\n<h2>Do: Set Boundaries</h2>\n<p>Once the both of you have talked, and you agree taking a break is best, it&#8217;s time to set some boundaries. Because running into confusion and a hurtful situation down the road will not help anything.</p>\n<p>But the boundaries may look quite different for each couple. It&#8217;s all in what you feel comfortable with.</p>\n<p>Will you still consider yourselves in a relationship during the break? Or will you be officially single during this time frame? Then you may want to discuss if you&#8217;ll date or sleep with other people.</p>\n<p>Be very careful, and crystal clear, in deciding what is acceptable and what is not. You both need to feel secure and have an understanding. Not only for your break but in the relationship that may follow it.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t: Communicate During a Break</h2>\n<p>A break means exactly that. And that includes taking a break in communication.</p>\n<p>When you suddenly find yourself without someone who has taken up a big part of your life, it&#8217;s natural to feel a void. And in turn, it&#8217;s natural to keep going back to this person.</p>\n<p>But you need this break to clear your mind and reflect. Having regular communication or even checking in with your partner will only muddy things up.</p>\n<p>Use this time apart to gain insight into yourself, your partner, and your relationship. And to do that successfully, you&#8217;ll need space without interruption.</p>\n<h2>Do: Set a Realistic Time Frame</h2>\n<p>Taking a break in a relationship without an end in sight may create turmoil and anxiety. And in reality, an open break is a breakup. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a good idea to set a time frame.</p>\n<p>Make it a time frame that both of you feel comfortable with. You may feel a week is enough time apart. Or you might need a month.</p>\n<p>Just be sure to respect that time frame once it&#8217;s set. You may go half-way through and know you want to stay with your partner. But they may need more time.</p>\n<p>Seeing the time frame through will ensure everyone gets the space they need.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t: Focus Solely on Your Partner&#8217;s Needs</h2>\n<p>Sure, a break is a time to reflect on your relationship and your partner&#8217;s needs. But don&#8217;t forget about yourself in the process.</p>\n<p>Your needs and well-being are important. So <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/individuals/\">use this time for YOU</a>!</p>\n<p>Spend time on hobbies you enjoy. Reach out to family and friends. And getting <a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/6-workouts-that-make-you-feel-good-when-youre-having-the-worst-day-ever-5540221\">physically active</a> will release &#8220;feel good&#8221; hormones that can help you get through this difficult situation.</p>\n<p>Taking care of yourself throughout a relationship break will give you the self-confidence to make the right decision.</p>\n<h2>Do: Ask Yourself the Important Questions</h2>\n<p>While you&#8217;re taking time to focus on yourself, it&#8217;s also the time to start facing the important questions.</p>\n<p>Are you seeing things clearly from both sides and understanding your partner&#8217;s concerns? Are you putting the kind of effort into the relationship you should be? Or are you pointing fingers and <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/5-steps-to-stop-blaming-o_b_7837134\">placing blame</a>?</p>\n<p>The time you spend alone while taking a break will also leave you with other questions to answer.</p>\n<p>Are you happier without your partner around? Can you not imagine a future without them? Or are you hanging on because you don&#8217;t want to be alone?</p>\n<p>Asking yourself the hard questions will get you down to the nitty-gritty part of your feelings. The part that will lead you to make a decision about your relationship that&#8217;s best for both involved.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t: Set Unrealistic Expectations</h2>\n<p>Nobody and no situation is perfect. So setting unrealistic expectations on your relationship and your partner will only be setting yourselves up for failure.</p>\n<p>Realize every relationship takes work. Mistakes are going to happen and feelings are going to get hurt. But it&#8217;s how much of yourself you&#8217;re willing to invest in this relationship that will dictate the outcome.</p>\n<p>Be realistic about each of your needs and weaknesses. Be honest about the role each of you plays. And know to start fresh, you need to set expectations that create a relationship worth fighting for.</p>\n<h2>Taking a Break Provides Relationship Clarity</h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;re in the midst of a murky relationship, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with wanting to take a step back to see things more clearly. In fact, taking a break may provide the exact clarity you need. Only then will you be confident enough to know how to move forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

Most couples want more sex in general. Figuring out how to get the spark back is often a matter of conquering the ego.</p>\n<p>There is hope for any couple out there struggling to return to their early days of regular intimacy. It&#8217;s going to take some self-reflection, dedication, and consistency. The solution may even be found outside the relationship.</p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s take a look at some practical solutions to find the lost spark in a relationship. Here are our top picks for steps that you can take today to reignite that sexual fire.</p>\n<h2>More Romantic Dates</h2>\n<p>After the first few years, most couples start to become less interested in dating. It&#8217;s this complacency that waters down the level of romance between each other. Don&#8217;t settle for mediocre for the sake of convenience or laziness.</p>\n<p>Plan a night out every week to go on a date and end with a night of sex. Give your partner something to look forward to every week. Reward them with a little pampering and you&#8217;ll soon get those juices flowing again.</p>\n<h2>Explore Your Partner&#8217;s Needs</h2>\n<p>Communication is the backbone to any healthy relationship. Sexual needs often take the back burner for topics of discussion, unfortunately. <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">Couples therapy</a> is often misinterpreted as only something for relationships on the rocks.</p>\n<p>The truth is, if you can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t talk about each other&#8217;s needs, then maybe someone else can. In fact, you may not even know that your partner craves more sex, a particular type of sex, and more exploration. If you can&#8217;t flat-out ask them, then consider other avenues to start the conversation.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t Fear the Kink</h2>\n<p>BDSM, poly, and pansexual adventures can transform the entire relationship. It isn&#8217;t just about the sex itself, either. Couples that are more open to trying new experiences, <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/couples-sex-tips-relationship-rules\">stay together longer</a>.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t know where to start? Ease into the kinkier lifestyles by joining Facebook groups together and starting a conversation. BDSM and poly couples that have a lifetime of experience together will make your kinky fun safe and enjoyable.</p>\n<h2>Sexual Health</h2>\n<p>Addressing any underlying conditions that prevent you from having sex normally is key. Ignoring these problems or hiding them from your partner is selfish. Common conditions like erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, or inability to orgasm are treatable.</p>\n<p>You have to diagnose the source of these sexual problems or they will only get worse. ED can be treated with medications or a complete lifestyle change. Remember, <a href=\"https://www.self.com/story/how-stress-affects-sex-life\">stress affects many aspects</a> of our sexual health, for men and women.</p>\n<p>Men struggle with performance, while women lose libido or the ability to orgasm altogether. Discuss this with your partner and start taking back your sex life.</p>\n<h2>Sweat it Out</h2>\n<p>Speaking of a healthy lifestyle, partner exercise sessions can enhance sex drive and performance. Exercise helps get those endorphins going, improving your mood, desire, and confidence. Do a round of exercise in the morning, get the blood pumping, and end with a romp.</p>\n<p>The increase in circulation will increase pleasure, intensity, hardness, and stamina for both parties. The sweat also ads to the experience, as our natural pheromones trigger the inner-animal.</p>\n<h2>Warm-Ups</h2>\n<p>The physiological action that regular exercise provides is just one way to get things started. When you&#8217;re both sitting on the couch with nothing to do, kick things off with some foreplay. Taking things slowly allows you to enjoy the moment without having to worry about performance.</p>\n<p>Women, in particular, have a difficult time jumping straight into sex. Their bodies have multiple erogenous zones. If you&#8217;re just hitting one key, it takes longer to warm up the entire instrument.</p>\n<p>Plus, the act of worshiping and appreciating the entire body is an emotional experience. Men should also be more open to full-body foreplay. It&#8217;s a turn on for women to see their partner relaxed and confident with themselves.</p>\n<p>Next time, try using various foreplay activities to warm up. Don&#8217;t rush this activity, it should naturally progress into sex, not be an obstacle.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t Over-Analyze It</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re comparing your sex life to a magazine article in the grocery store, you&#8217;re setting yourself up for failure. Sexperts aren&#8217;t substitutes for counselors or doctors. Don&#8217;t abide by rigid numbers of &#8220;sex goals&#8221; or funky bedroom positions.</p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t purchase that sexual spark back, no matter how many trendy sex toys or items you buy. There are few exceptions, like if your partner has never owned a vibrator, but you have to work on core issues first. What you &#8220;should&#8221; do and what magazines suggest usually don&#8217;t line up.</p>\n<h2>Spunky Spontaneity</h2>\n<p>This last piece of advice is probably the one most uttered, but it&#8217;s still relevant. Spontaneous sex is the best sex. Period. Wake your partner up with sex. Walk behind them in the kitchen and bend them over.</p>\n<p>Do some covert public petting and touching. This is the type of stuff that keeps couples feeling young again. Combine this level of spontaneity with planned dates, getaways, and presents. Send your partner a text telling them to expect something when they get off to work.</p>\n<p>Add a naughty wink to your text and you&#8217;ve just revved up their engine for the rest of the day. Be creative with your surprises and your love life will be anything but routine.</p>\n<h2>Finding Out How to Get the Spark Back</h2>\n<p>Did our guide get ideas flowing through your head? We hope it has given you something to build upon. Whatever you do, don&#8217;t give up on a romantic relationship that has turned cold.</p>\n<p>People can change, they will learn how to get that spark back if they see you making an effort. It takes two to tango, but it might take a teacher to show them the steps. With our experienced couples counselors, you can save your relationship from fizzling out.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

It&#8217;s important that you dedicate time and put in the work to stay happy and <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/healthy-relationships.aspx\">keep your relationship healthy</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the best ways to build a strong relationship with your significant other is simply spending time together. There are great couples activities that can give you the opportunity to connect with each other.</p>\n<p>These activities can be exciting and active, but they can also be simple and relaxing. The important thing is that you are doing something together. Every new experience you share is an opportunity to learn something new about your partner.</p>\n<p>Below, we&#8217;re sharing a list of ten couples activities to inspire you and your partner to spend time together. Read on to learn more.</p>\n<h2>1. Take a Cooking Class</h2>\n<p>One of the best bonding activities couples can try together is a cooking class. When you are both learning something new, you have the opportunity to work together as a team and complement each other with your individual strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>A cooking class is a particularly good setting for this because you are receiving the instruction from someone else, rather than telling each other what to do. That could eliminate any potential for one of you to be controlling or to take on too much of the work.</p>\n<p>At the end of the class, you&#8217;ll have learned how to make a delicious meal. Each time you recreate it at home can be an opportunity to relive the happy memory of the class.</p>\n<h2>2. Read a Book</h2>\n<p>Reading a book may seem like something each individual does alone, but it can actually be one of the best activities to do as a couple. Think of it a little bit like a two-person book club. Select the same title to read, and pick a date that you both agree to finish it by.</p>\n<p>Once you have both finished reading the book, set up a time to discuss it together. You may be surprised at how much you have to say, and how quickly you get into an in-depth discussion of what you liked and what you didn&#8217;t like.</p>\n<p>Even if you don&#8217;t have the same opinion, have a common topic to discuss can be a great conversation starter.</p>\n<h2>3. Travel Somewhere New</h2>\n<p>As far as couple activities go, there is nothing better than experiencing something for the first time at the same time. Sharing a moment of pure discovery will naturally bond you and your partner together and help your relationship feel stronger.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/nomanazish/2018/01/22/five-reasons-why-travel-is-good-for-your-mental-health/#760165a35934\">Travel has lots of benefits</a>; going to a new place together will create opportunities for you and your significant other to share those novel moments.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to travel anywhere far or exotic either. A simple trip to a nearby town you&#8217;ve never been to or a new state can be just as special.</p>\n<h2>4. Get Active</h2>\n<p>Activities for couples that help your body stay healthy can also go a long way in keeping your relationship happy. When you and your significant other exercise together, you can feel good about the fact that you are doing something healthy for yourself as well.</p>\n<p>There are lots of options for couple&#8217;s exercise, so you can find the activity that works best for your dynamic. If you enjoy being competitive with each other, a sport like tennis could work well. On the other hand, if competing is usually a negative experience, you could do something much simpler, like going for a walk together or taking the same yoga class.</p>\n<h2>5. Talk It Out</h2>\n<p>Scheduling sessions for couple&#8217;s therapy is one of the most positive activities to do as a couple. A lot of people think that couple&#8217;s therapy is only relevant when they are fighting or when there is an issue that needs to be resolved.</p>\n<p>Even happy couples with no significant issues can <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">benefit from therapy</a>. It can improve communication, because some things are just easier to say with an objective person in the room.</p>\n<h2>6. Go Green</h2>\n<p>Improving your outdoor space with a flower or vegetable garden is one of the most rewarding activities for couples. You will be able to see the physical proof of the hard work that you&#8217;ve accomplished together. Planting and caring for a garden also shows that you&#8217;re willing to invest in something to make it better.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have the space for a garden in your own home, look into a local community garden and schedule time each week to visit together.</p>\n<h2>7. Help out in the Community</h2>\n<p>If you and your significant other are looking for activities for couples that will bring a deep sense of meaning to your life &#8211; and your relationship &#8211; consider volunteering together. Community organizations and nonprofits always have a need for helpers who are willing to dedicate their time and services.</p>\n<p>Volunteering to help those less fortunate also encourages reflection and appreciation, which can be beneficial to your relationship.</p>\n<h2>8. Get Season Tickets</h2>\n<p>Getting season tickets to experience something that you and your partner both love makes for one of the most fun couples activities. It could be a local sports team, a local theater, or a local concert series.</p>\n<p>The important thing is that it is recurring. Having a regular, standing date or reason to get out of the house is exciting, and it takes the pressure off of date night when you don&#8217;t have to think of something to do.</p>\n<h2>9. Visit a Museum</h2>\n<p>Every trip to a museum is an opportunity to broaden your perspective by learning more about others. That&#8217;s a skill set that is also very useful in a healthy relationship, which is what makes museum visits such valuable activities to do as a couple.</p>\n<p>Talking about and comparing your experiences in the space may also lead to other, broader conversations about the way you see and experience the world.</p>\n<h2>10. Take a Trip down Memory Lane</h2>\n<p>Reflecting on your relationship&#8217;s past is a helpful way to think about its future. One of the most fun couples activities for you and your partner could be to recreate a date you had from earlier in your relationship. Maybe you could go back to a restaurant you loved when you were first dating, or another place that was special to you early on.</p>\n<h2>Ready to Start Trying Couples Activities?</h2>\n<p>Bonding over a shared experience can open you and your partner up to sharing even more. Couples activities are helpful for all couples in any stage of their relationship, so let these ideas inspire you to spend more time together.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

After all, it&#8217;s the pinnacle of human experience, right? There&#8217;s no way anyone&#8217;s ever going to ask you to have sex and you&#8217;re going to say, &#8220;You know, I&#8217;m just not feeling it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But then you grew up, maybe had some kids, reality set in, and you realized that tonight, you were way too tired to do anything. Sometimes, it can seem hard to get the fires burning and get excited about sex again. If you&#8217;re looking for some ways to spice up your love life, read on for ideas.</p>\n<h2>1. Get Some Massage Oil</h2>\n<p>Massage oil is a beautiful thing, and it can do wonders for your sex life. A lot of the times, especially if you have children, things can get hectic. Finding the time to keep up a healthy sex life can feel like just another chore on the to-do list.</p>\n<p>One way to make things feel natural and sexy again is to break out some oil and offer to give your partner a massage. They will love the massage and the feel of the oil, and you&#8217;ll get to spend time touching them without any pressure to get it on immediately. The slow burn arousal will build up and make for an amazing, steamy night.</p>\n<h2>2. Get Chatty</h2>\n<p>One great way to build up excitement about having sex before anyone ever gets undressed is to talk it up. Dirty talk can be fantastic in the bedroom, but it doesn&#8217;t have to stay there. And if you&#8217;re shy about dirty talking in person, this can be an awesome way to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/reigniting-the-fire-how-to-talk-about-sex-with-your-partner/\">avoid awkward wording worries</a> and still get the thrill.</p>\n<p>Spend the day texting with your partner about what you want to do to them when you both get home. Tell them what you have planned and if you want to, maybe snap a sexy picture or two in the bathroom. Talking all day about what you&#8217;ll do when you get home will have you both wild for it by the time the day is over.</p>\n<h2>3. Ramp Up the Anticipation</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re going out for a night out, the getting ready part of the evening can be as seductive as the coming home. A part of the fun of sex is the anticipation &#8211; slowing down and taking the time to look and appreciate. So why not give your partner the opportunity to do that and then spend some time daydreaming about you afterward?</p>\n<p>While you&#8217;re getting ready for your night out, try putting on your clothes on last. Do your makeup, shave, or do your hair wearing only sexy underwear (or nothing at all). If your partner tries to enjoy the show early, shoo them off until after you get home when they&#8217;ll be drooling over you.</p>\n<h2>4. Make Out During the Commercials</h2>\n<p>Do you remember being a teenager and making out with someone and feeling like there was a time limit before someone caught you? The excitement of the time limit made everything all the more tantalizing. Playing this little game can bring some of that back into your love life.</p>\n<p>Sit down to watch a game or a show with your partner, and agree you can only make out during the commercials. When the show comes back on, you have to stop until the next commercial break. By the time the show is over, you&#8217;ll be raring to go, and we guarantee you&#8217;ll never enjoy the commercials so much.</p>\n<h2>5. Set Up Signals</h2>\n<p>If you ever took a freshman psychology class, you&#8217;ve heard of Pavlov&#8217;s dogs and classical conditioning. While it may sound strange to bring psychology into the bedroom, classical conditioning works as well with libido as it does with hunger. But instead of using food, we recommend leaving your partner sexy little signals.</p>\n<p>Get a pouch of red beads, small stones, or basically any small beautiful object. Give some to your partner and agree when they leave one somewhere for you, you&#8217;ll have sex within the next 24 hours. It&#8217;ll turn into a great way to ask for sex without saying &#8220;So&#8230; you wanna?&#8221; and you&#8217;ll get a thrill every time you find one of the signals.</p>\n<h2>6. Leave Love Notes</h2>\n<p>On the subject of leaving treats for your partner to find, whatever happened to the good old-fashioned love note? Cute texts are wonderful, and it&#8217;s nice to hear sweet nothings whispered in your ear. But there&#8217;s something nice about the time it takes to write out a note and the happy surprise of finding it waiting for you.</p>\n<p>Leaving love notes around for your partner to find can be a great way to add some new passion to your love life. Whether the note is sweet and romantic or too hot to handle, it&#8217;ll make your partner happy. And according to a study, <a href=\"https://thoughtcatalog.com/natalie-gontcharova/2016/03/science-says-if-youre-having-more-sex-than-your-friends-youre-also-a-happier-person/\">happy people have more sex</a>, which makes them happier &#8211; it&#8217;s the best kind of cycle.</p>\n<h2>7. Watch a Movie Together</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been a couple for a long time, you&#8217;ve probably had a movie date night. It&#8217;s nice to pick out a film together, get some popcorn, and snuggle into the couch to watch the story unfold. But for this date night, we have a suggestion for making things steamier: instead of watching a rom-com or thriller, try watching some porn.</p>\n<p>Yes, porn is ridiculous and has <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/lorynbrantz/9-unrealistic-expectations-bad-porn-leads-men-to-believe\">very little to do</a> with actual sex. But there is something undeniably sexy about watching other people get it on. So pick a flick you and your partner are both into, get the porn rolling, and see where the night takes you.</p>\n<h2>Find More Ways to Spice Up Your Love Life</h2>\n<p>Having good sex often is a key part of a happy life for many people. Using some of these ideas can bring passion back into your love life and remind you of what it felt like to fall in love with your partner the first time.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Relationships are complicated. Nobody goes into or comes out of one assuming they&#8217;ll be easy. And every relationship we go into brings entirely new factors into play. After all, even <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/individuals/\">understanding ourselves</a> can be a challenge sometimes.</p>\n<p>With so much to consider, how do we help to grease the wheels of our relationship so that it works better overall? A good place to start is with a thorough understanding of the importance of communication. With that in mind, join us today, as we bring you seven important roles communication plays in any relationship.</p>\n<h2>1. It Helps Strengthen Respect</h2>\n<p>Effectively communicating within a couple allows both parties to develop their respect for each other. The idea is simple: people are emphatic. They can understand on a very subtle level when something&#8217;s wrong.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also <a href=\"https://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/healthy-relationships/\">a sign</a> of a healthy relationship. When it comes to talking about what&#8217;s going on in your life, they understand more by what you don&#8217;t say than what you do. When you have something to say, whether it&#8217;s good or bad, you need to say it.</p>\n<p>Your partner may have insights you aren&#8217;t expecting, and going through it together will help to strengthen your bond. More than that, however, it indicates you respect them enough to be mindful of how this might affect them, and you&#8217;re honest enough to speak plainly. A lack of communication can have the opposite effect.</p>\n<h2>2. It Takes The Guesswork Out</h2>\n<p>Mark Twain said: &#8220;If you tell the truth, you don&#8217;t have to remember anything&#8221;. This is one of the biggest benefits of honest communication within a relationship.</p>\n<p>A healthy connection with someone doesn&#8217;t come from withholding and remembering a string of little lies. It comes from being transparent with them.</p>\n<p>Learning how to improve communication skills means you can go about your business, never having to worry about getting &#8220;found out&#8221;. Your relationship becomes simpler, leaving both of you less stressed and, ultimately, happier.</p>\n<h2>3. It Helps To Avoid Misunderstandings</h2>\n<p>As close as we may become with our partners, every relationship is made up of two unique people. And everybody has bad days.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we miscommunicate. Other times, we forget to say things that are important, and the intricate gears of our relationship get gummed up.</p>\n<p>Communicating helps to prevent miscommunications&#8211;it&#8217;s as simple as that. When we express ourselves to the people we love, fewer things go unsaid. We become more used to explaining concepts and ideas in a way other people understand.</p>\n<p>And, overall, the people we love come to expect the truth from us. This is a much healthier kind of relationship, and it takes the pressure off when you aren&#8217;t worried about saying the wrong thing.</p>\n<h2>4. It Builds Trust</h2>\n<p>Trust is <a href=\"https://www.wellandgood.com/good-advice/why-trust-important-relationship/\">one of those factors</a> in a relationship that is both important and more than a little time-consuming. It takes time to develop trust, as they say, and not without good reason. Without an intrinsic trust in the person you&#8217;re in a relationship with, you can&#8217;t let the relationship breathe enough to ever be able to grow.</p>\n<p>This kind of hard work is a big part of why many relationships fail in the long run. Both partners have to be consistently open with each other, communicating honestly. Better communication between you and your partner leads to more trust in each other, and better trust leads to more confidence.</p>\n<p>Effective communication techniques help to make you and your partner feel secure. Without that, it would be hard for any relationship to prosper.</p>\n<h2>5. It Lets Partners Support Each Other</h2>\n<p>Sometimes the best benefits are the simplest. Life can get difficult, and in dozens of unique and wonderful ways. When it does and we&#8217;re single, the result is that we usually have to live through it alone. Not in a relationship.</p>\n<p>The problem comes when we don&#8217;t communicate our hardships with each other. When you run into personal challenges, you need to make yourself available so that your partner can be there for you, even when it doesn&#8217;t seem like it. They can offer you a shoulder to lean on, which is great, but they&#8217;ll also get the benefit of knowing they were a part of your process.</p>\n<p>Remember: nothing can get better if your partner doesn&#8217;t know anything is wrong. If you can improve communication skills between the two of you, you&#8217;ll each be the support the other one needs.</p>\n<h2>6. It Helps To Grow Love Between Partners</h2>\n<p>Love is, and this is going to sound corny, a lot like a flower. You have to water it. When we let our communication go stale, our love can suffer from lack of nourishment.</p>\n<p>We can&#8217;t expect to continue earning love from someone if we stop communicating entirely with them. Sometimes the love in a relationship just dies down, and there&#8217;s nothing you can do to revive it.</p>\n<p>But, more often than not, what&#8217;s missing is honest communication. The kind that got you to fall in love in the first place. You have to be able to remind each why it was you fell in love.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re putting in the effort from both sides to keep the fires stoked, you run less risk of drifting apart.</p>\n<h2>7. It&#8217;s Great For Your Mood</h2>\n<p>One of the greatest gifts in any relationship is being able to express your genuine happiness to someone. When someone is genuinely happy and has a partner with whom their communication is sound, their happiness can be like an echo chamber.</p>\n<p>When you are honest and joyful about something in your life, that honest communication allows us to express our emotions. And, when we do that, that elation feeds into both parties.</p>\n<p>Sharing your happiness with someone, openly, sets a mood of happiness that helps to create more of the same. This is a healthier way to process our emotions and a natural booster for any relationship.</p>\n<h2>The Importance Of Communication In Your Relationship</h2>\n<p>People say all the time that communication is vital to any healthy relationship. What they don&#8217;t tell you is why. How many things hinge on you and your partner being able to say what you mean to each other. How it affects your mood, your love for each other, and even your day-to-day stress levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

But some factors can cause more bumps on the road than others. Finances, child rearing, or aging parents are just a few examples.</p>\n<p>If your relationship is on the rocks, are there ways to strengthen your relationship? Or is it time to break up and move on?</p>\n<p>According to researchers, a typical marriage only has a <a href=\"http://time.com/4575495/divorce-rate-nearly-40-year-low/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">50 percent chance of lasting</a>. But don&#8217;t give up! Divorce and separation are not the only options.</p>\n<p>There are ways you can save your relationship. Read on to find out how to strengthen your relationship and overcome challenges.</p>\n<h2>Train Your Mind</h2>\n<p>One of the most important ways to improve your relationship is to change your mindset. When you go through ups and downs, it can be easy to think negatively about each other.</p>\n<p>You need to change your mindset and focus on the positive. After all, you fell in love with your partner for a reason. That&#8217;s why you got together in the first place.</p>\n<p>Try to focus on your partner&#8217;s good qualities, not their negative traits. You could try writing them down and keeping the list close at hand. Then refer to the list when things aren&#8217;t going so well.</p>\n<p>It might surprise you how many positive qualities you can write down. It may help you to fall in love with them all over again.</p>\n<h2>Show Your Love</h2>\n<p>Being positive shouldn&#8217;t only stay in the mind.</p>\n<p>An important way to improve your relationship is to show your love. Be kind, affectionate, and use positive words. Make it a daily habit.</p>\n<p>Be generous with compliments and let your partner know how much you love and appreciate them. It might sound soppy, but these expressions of affection can help you treasure each other.</p>\n<h2>Make Your Partner Your Best Friend</h2>\n<p>A house needs a solid foundation to stay upright and weather the storms. Similarly, a healthy relationship needs a solid foundation of friendship. If you have this underlying friendship, it will help you get through problems more easily.</p>\n<p>Try to treat your partner in the same respectful manner as you treat your friends. Be kind and appreciate them, support them, and listen to them. And don&#8217;t forget to have fun together.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;d never disrespect your friend in a rude manner. S, why would you do it to your partner? You should actually treat your partner better than your friends, not the other way round.</p>\n<h2>Make Love, Not War</h2>\n<p>One key to the question &#8220;how to strengthen your relationship?&#8221; is physical intimacy. Getting physical is a natural, healthy part of a relationship.</p>\n<p>At the end of a long tiring day, you may not feel in the mood. But you should make time for it &#8211; it&#8217;s important. Put in that extra effort, and you&#8217;ll feel a lot closer to each other.</p>\n<p>A relationship without physical intimacy may lose emotional intimacy too. Without that personal connection, a couple may drift apart. They might even start to look elsewhere for that intimate connection.</p>\n<h2>Spend Time Together</h2>\n<p>How to strengthen your relationship? One important factor is time. You must spend a lot of time together to make it work.</p>\n<p>It can be difficult to stay connected, especially when you have a lot of other commitments going on. From work and kids to household chores and grocery shopping, it can be hard to make time for each other. But this effort can reap positive results.</p>\n<p>Try to keep things interesting too, or you may become bored. The so-called &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090429172241.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">7-year itch</a>&#8221; can cause a break in a relationship.</p>\n<p>When you first got together, you no doubt did exciting things. Go out on dates, plan weekend getaways, or spend cozy nights away from the kids. As you draw closer to each other and enjoy the time you spend together, your bond will become stronger.</p>\n<h2>Discuss, Don&#8217;t Fight</h2>\n<p>Disagreements are inevitable in any relationship. But instead of letting them turn into a full-blown fight, try to discuss the matter calmly. That&#8217;s easier said than done, but practice makes perfect.</p>\n<p>Try to keep the discussions short and sweet. When disagreements surface and you repeat arguments over and over, words can start to get nasty. You may not be able to come up with a solution at the time, so take a break and come back to the matter a little later.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t play games with each other&#8217;s feelings, such as using the silent treatment, as it will only make matters worse. Try to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>Listen Carefully</h2>\n<p>Listen attentively to your partner and don&#8217;t be judgemental. This will help your partner see that their feelings are important to you.</p>\n<p>Being a good listener will not only help you discern their true feelings, but it can also allow your partner to open up freely. If they feel they&#8217;re being respected and valued, they are more likely to share their emotions.</p>\n<h2>Learn to Forgive</h2>\n<p>Be realistic about your expectations.</p>\n<p>When you experience problems in your relationship, you should not conclude that it was a mistake to get together in the first place. Remember that everybody makes mistakes. You can probably recall times you&#8217;ve made mistakes too.</p>\n<p>Instead of pointing the finger, <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/individuals/\">take a look at yourself</a>. Accept that both parties will make mistakes. Resolve your differences and be forgiving.</p>\n<p>Letting it go and forgiving will have a positive effect on yourself too. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/forgiveness/art-20047692\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">researchers have found</a> that letting go of grudges can result in improved health and peace of mind.</p>\n<h2>How to Strengthen Your Relationship</h2>\n<p>One of the best ways to improve your relationship is to get professional help. But that&#8217;s expensive, isn&#8217;t it? Actually, there are programs that can help you for free.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Our Relationship&#8221; program can help you to solve relationship issues.

Though making a lifelong commitment and companionship were also highly valued as reasons to tie the knot.</p>\n<p>Marriage isn&#8217;t always easy. While the <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/10-most-common-reasons-people-divorce_b_8086312\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reasons why couples divorce</a> may vary, it often boils down to poor communication between two people. Sometimes it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t realize they&#8217;re both speaking different love languages. While your spouse may express themselves with touching, you may feel verbally expressing yourself is how you share love. Understanding love languages is a huge key to having a loving and fulfilling relationship that lasts.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to answer the question, what is my love language? Or if you just want to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">communicate better as a couple</a>, keep reading. We&#8217;ll help you determine what is your love language.</p>\n<h2>The Different Love Languages</h2>\n<p>In 1995, Dr. Gary Chapman wrote a book entitled, &#8220;The Five Love Languages&#8221;. Since then, the book has become more and more popular.</p>\n<p>Dr. Chapman believes that all five love languages should be incorporated into your relationship. However, to get the most out of your relationship, it&#8217;s important to focus on knowing what both you and your mate&#8217;s favorite action is to get the best reaction.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s learn about the five love languages.</p>\n<h2>1. Physical Touch</h2>\n<p>From the moment a child is born, mothers are encouraged to place their newborns on their chest. Babies are held in neonatal units.</p>\n<p>The need for physical touch doesn&#8217;t diminish as we get older. There are countless studies that show the <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-touching-your-partner-can-make-both-of-you-healthier#5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">physical and mental benefits</a> from being touched by others.</p>\n<p>Physical touch doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean over-the-top PDA that grosses out everyone else. Instead, it means holding hands, kissing, and hugging. It can even mean sitting close to your loved one.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a way for couples to feel connected and safe.</p>\n<p>However, not everyone grew up in a household where physical touch was a priority. But if they&#8217;re in a relationship with someone whose primary love language is physical touch, that person may end up feeling unloved, no matter how many gifts and words of love are used on them.</p>\n<h2>2. Receiving Gifts</h2>\n<p>Just because someone&#8217;s love language is receiving gifts, it doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re a gold digger or that they only crave materialistic things to feel valued and loved.</p>\n<p>It does mean that receiving something thoughtful and meaningful such as bringing them home their favorite candy bar after a tough week will make them feel appreciated and loved.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to go overboard and spend a ton of money, even small gifts make them feel as though they&#8217;re on your mind. This is one of the easier love languages to learn, especially if you didn&#8217;t grow up in a home where gift giving was a priority.</p>\n<h2>3. Acts of Service</h2>\n<p>The acts of service love language is different than the receiving gifts love language. You may recognize that your partner identifies with this love language if you hear them say that actions speak louder than words.</p>\n<p>Acts of service don&#8217;t have to be huge, grand gestures. Instead, something simple such as cooking your spouse their favorite meal, unloading the dishwasher or even picking up their dry cleaning are all perfect examples of acts of service.</p>\n<p>All of these actions are simple, but they require time, effort, and thought. It&#8217;s the time, effort, and thought that your loved one will appreciate the most.</p>\n<p>However, if you perform these acts out of a sense of obligation and/or make a big deal out of it, this love language will backfire on you. Instead, perform acts of service out of love and the desire to make the other person happy for best results.</p>\n<h2>4. Quality Time</h2>\n<p>The quality time love language is about giving someone your undivided attention. That means time spent with someone you love without your smartphone, the latest football game being on tv or any other types of distractions.</p>\n<p>While you can still curl up in front of the television together to watch something you both love, the main focus should be on dedicating time together with no distractions. No friends or family allowed.</p>\n<p>Doing so helps the person whose love language is quality time feel comforted and valued.</p>\n<p>However, if you&#8217;re prone to canceling or postponing this together time, it will hurt your partner. And it&#8217;s not enough to be with someone physically but not emotionally.</p>\n<p>Taking someone out to dinner and then chatting up your waiter while ignoring your loved one is not considered quality time. If you&#8217;re easily distracted, opt for quality time where there are few or no distractions such as taking a walk in nature together.</p>\n<h2>5. Words of Affirmation</h2>\n<p>Whoever said, &#8220;sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me&#8221; didn&#8217;t have words of affirmation as their primary love language. Words can and do hurt people.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to be Shakespeare or Cyrano de Bergerac to build up your partner. In fact, it&#8217;s often the shortest and simplest words that carry the most meaning.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re beautiful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That color looks incredible on you!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I love how good you are with our kids.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Little compliments and telling someone &#8220;I love you&#8221; goes a long way. But on the flip-side, rude, mean, insulting comments will tear down the person you love quickly.</p>\n<p>And it will be harder for that person to forgive (and forget) those horrible words you&#8217;ve used. Choose your words wisely if you love someone whose love language is words of affirmation.</p>\n<h2>Get Help With Your Relationships</h2>\n<p>Whether <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/individuals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">you&#8217;re single</a> or in a committed relationship, everyone deserves to have loving relationships with everyone in their lives. Learning how others express themselves and respond to love can vastly change your experiences with others. Understanding the different love languages can help you do that.</p>\n<p>We can help too.

These include trust issues, unmet expectations, and compatibility to name a few. Fighting consistently can also lead to a troublesome relationship, and if handled poorly, could end the relationship altogether. While fighting in a relationship is normal (no one is perfect!) there are ways to stop fighting and handle your conflict with poise and understanding.</p>\n<p>Fighting well takes time and commitment to get to the root of the problem no matter what it is. If you&#8217;re in a relationship where you find yourself fighting more than having fun with your significant other, rest assured, there are ways to stop fighting and enjoy each other more.</p>\n<h2>How to Stop Fighting in A Relationship</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re tired of fighting with your significant other, here are some ways you can halt it before it gets worse.</p>\n<h3>1. Dodge the Defensive</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s normal and natural to want to become immediately defensive when a fight erupts. You may feel attacked, wronged, or blamed for something you didn&#8217;t do. Taking criticism or statements from your partner as personal only adds fuel to the fire.</p>\n<p>But, objectively evaluating the situation is the best course. Did you say or do something causing hurt to them? If so, work to make it right.</p>\n<p>This could include apologizing, fixing what happened, or just asking how you can make it right. Often, it isn&#8217;t about you as a person, but what happened. Be receptive to what the other person has to say and internalize it, asking questions if you need to.</p>\n<h3>2. Step Away From the Situation to Cool Down</h3>\n<p>Often during a fight, our thoughts and emotions can become cloudy or irrational. Fighting in this mindset causes more discourse, as we typically say things we don&#8217;t really mean.</p>\n<p>If the argument becomes too heated, step away for a while and regain your perspective. Allow your mind to cool down by taking a walk or spending some time alone. Usually, you can approach the conflict with a renewed attitude once you clear your head.</p>\n<h3>3. Always Fight or Argue Face to Face</h3>\n<p>In our digital world, we can think before we text giving us an opportunity to control our conversation. But not everyone reads texts and tones the same way, and your partner could be taking what you &#8216;say&#8217; completely out of context, paving the way for more fighting.</p>\n<p>When people fight face-to-face body language is clearer and it&#8217;s easier to pick up on vocal tone. If an argument is especially complex or intesnse, long, drawn-out text messages are difficult to type out and are best discussed in person.</p>\n<h3>4. Create Boundaries for A Fight</h3>\n<p>Fighting becomes out of hand when you attack the person&#8217;s character instead of the problem itself. Swearing, yelling over each other, and avoiding the real problem can all mount and the fight becomes an all-out war.</p>\n<p>Sit down with your partner and discuss some boundaries for when you fight. For example, one person may speak first in a respectful tone with no yelling or name calling. These destructive behaviors redirect you from the issue needing attention and create an unsafe space for each other to feel heard and accepted.</p>\n<h3>5. Remember Why You&#8217;re in The Relationship</h3>\n<p>Though <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/8-physical-signs-youre-in-the-honeymoon-phase-of-a-relationship-9588418\">the honeymoon phase</a> of your relationship might be waning or completely over, it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a lost cause. Many people go on to have successful, deeply fulfilling relationships long after they&#8217;ve first started dating or after the first years of marriage.</p>\n<p>This could be because they remembered why they&#8217;re in the relationship and what they love about their partner. They realized their lives are better with each other than without. Though everyone has their baggage and personal problems, there&#8217;s good to remember and this gives the relationship something to fight for.</p>\n<h3>6. Take Care of The Conflict as Soon as Possible</h3>\n<p>Couples who allow problems to intensify break up sooner than those who approach conflict quickly. Not speaking up and letting our feelings simmer brews unspoken resentment or bitterness which could permeate the relationship.</p>\n<p>This is damaging, especially if the other partner does not know. Coming clean about our feelings or issues and laying it all out on the table forces us to work through those problems so there&#8217;s nothing weighing on our minds throughout the course of the relationship.</p>\n<h3>7. Consider Therapy</h3>\n<p>If the fighting seems too difficult to handle on your own, or you&#8217;re feeling lost, consider couples therapy.</p>\n<p>Couples who choose to receive therapy can learn to relate to and understand each other better, and themselves. Therapy gives you an opportunity for a third party to peek inside your relationship and identify problem areas you may overlook.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/faq/\">good therapist</a> provides practical steps to work towards peace in your relationship. They can offer techniques to help you work through arguments and disagreements. Couples therapy is a wonderful outlet to express your thoughts.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, therapy goes both ways. While the therapist or counselor aims to provide you with constructive feedback, it doesn&#8217;t work unless you both commit to saving the relationship.</p>\n<h3>8. Take Some Time Apart</h3>\n<p>The stresses of our lives can trickle into our relationships. While it could be that things outside of your relationships are causing you stress, it&#8217;s true the relationship itself is just stressful.</p>\n<p>Think about taking time apart from each other for a time. It could be a weekend alone or with friends just to enjoy someplace or something you love.</p>\n<p>Be encouraged at times couples need to spend time apart. This could be for various reasons completely individual to the couple. It&#8217;s not necessarily a sign the relationship is in trouble.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, time away provides you with a different perspective on your relationship. If you return believing the relationship is at an end, discuss it with your partner.</p>\n<h2>Stop Fighting and Start Enjoying Each Other</h2>\n<p>Every couple goes through rough patches but constant fighting in a relationship is tiring and draining. When you stop fighting, you enjoy your relationship &#8211; and each other &#8211; more. Take these steps to your next argument and learn to solve the conflict in a healthy and productive way.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>When the <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/couples/\">two of you</a> first got together, you were inseparable. Your sexual chemistry was undeniable and you had a blast exploring each other&#8217;s bodies.</p>\n<p>But then, over time, things began to change.</p>\n<p>Your sexual activities went from a daily occurrence to a weekly or even monthly occurrence, and before you know it, you two haven&#8217;t touched each other in what feels like forever.</p>\n<p>Believe it or not, this is more common than you may think. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/contemplating-divorce/201512/is-why-many-couples-struggle-sex\">partners across both genders</a> reported feelings of sexual frustration and dissatisfaction.</p>\n<p>Of course, talking with a partner about sex can be difficult, especially if you&#8217;re already having issues.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t settle for an unhappy bedroom. Here are a few tips on how to talk about sex with your partner that can help you reignite the fire you thought was lost.</p>\n<h3>Shake off the Stigma</h3>\n<p>Be honest, you probably saw this headline and started to blush.</p>\n<p>From an early age, we&#8217;re taught that sexuality is something that should be hidden and never discussed. Suffice to say, that can lead to some pretty complicated issues down the road.</p>\n<p>But until you remove the stigma from sex, having an open, honest discussion with your partner will be quite a challenge.</p>\n<p>Talking sex, even with someone you love and trust, can be a bit embarrassing. But don&#8217;t pull away. The problem won&#8217;t go away if you don&#8217;t discuss it.</p>\n<p>Start framing sex like you would any other facet of your relationship. Despite what many of us are taught, it&#8217;s a healthy, normal part of life and should be treated as such.</p>\n<h3>Expect Some Discomfort</h3>\n<p>Because of the stigma, not everyone is comfortable talking about sex. Even if your sexual relationship with your partner is fine, they may become shy or timid anytime sex is mentioned.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s crucial that you respect your partner&#8217;s wishes while also stressing how important it is to you. Be careful not to come across as angry or accusatory.</p>\n<p>Instead, gently ask them why talking about sex makes them uncomfortable. Let them know that it hurts when they shut down and refuse to talk about it, and use this as a chance to open a dialogue.</p>\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a chance that you&#8217;re the more timid partner. If that&#8217;s the case, don&#8217;t feel guilty. Explore your feelings of discomfort and turn inward.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you had a religious upbringing that makes it difficult to explore your sexuality. With proper acknowledgment, you can work through those feelings.</p>\n<h3>Set Communication Ground Rules</h3>\n<p>Communication is at the heart of any healthy relationship, and it&#8217;s important that you&#8217;re always honest with your partner.</p>\n<p>With that said, talking sex with your partner can bring about some friction &#8230; and not necessarily in a good way. As a result, it may be a good idea to set some communication ground rules.</p>\n<p>First, agree to take the time needed to have such an important discussion. That may sound silly, but life can get so busy that it can be difficult to find time for such an important discussion. Both partners need to dedicate their full attention to the topic at hand.</p>\n<p>Next, watch how you speak to one another. If it gets heated, walk away for a few moments. Likewise, if both partners can&#8217;t stop blushing, agree to talk through it.</p>\n<p>Finally, don&#8217;t be afraid to express your needs. Let your partner know how important sex is to you. Tell them what you need to feel safe.</p>\n<p>Both partners should stick to a strict no-judgment policy throughout the discussion.</p>\n<h3>Practice Talking About Your Fantasies</h3>\n<p>One great way to become more comfortable talking about sex with your partner is to slowly tease out one another&#8217;s fantasies. We all have turn ons and turn offs, but we&#8217;re not always great about verbalizing our desires.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re struggling to talk about your fantasies, try using an <a href=\"http://mojoupgrade.com/\">online questionnaire</a>.</p>\n<p>Both partners separately fill out a few pages of basic information about their sexual interests based on a scale based on interest.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s great about this questionnaire is that it only shows you what you and your partner have in common, so you can answer openly and without fear.</p>\n<p>Go through the results together. What seems like a simple quiz can be used as a fantastic way to introduce some new kinks and fun into your sex life.</p>\n<p>This is a great example of why a no-judgment policy is a good idea, by the way. Both partners are likely going to learn some surprising things about one another, but judging is a surefire way to kill off any spark.</p>\n<h3>Approach the Situation as a Couple, Not as an Individual</h3>\n<p>Every problem you face is an opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com/about/\">grow your relationship</a>. Start viewing each problem as you and your partner against the issue instead of you and your partner against one another.</p>\n<p>A lot of this will come through your phrasing. No one wants to feel attacked, so be conscientious about how you address the issue.</p>\n<p>Use inclusive language like &#8216;we&#8217; and &#8216;us&#8217; throughout your dialogue to avoid coming off as accusatory.</p>\n<h3>Make Time for One Another</h3>\n<p>Talking about sex is one thing, but making time for it is another. Time can be a leading cause for a lack of intimacy.</p>\n<p>But like any other facet of your relationship, it&#8217;s up to the two of you to make time for it.</p>\n<p>Send each other flirty texts throughout the day to keep each other excited and interested. Make more of an effort to engage in physical affection, too.</p>\n<p>If all else fails, try to stick to the five-minute rule. Even if you&#8217;re exhausted, spend five minutes at the end of the day kissing, touching, or being intimate with your partner.</p>\n<p>Even if you&#8217;re still not in the mood, <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/42198-what-is-oxytocin.html\">you&#8217;ll release oxytocin</a>, a chemical that helps you and your partner bond.</p>\n<h3>How To Talk About Sex with Your Partner: A Few Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Talking about sex isn&#8217;t always something that comes easily. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t important, especially if you and your partner are looking to reignite that long-lost flame that still burns inside.</p>\n<p>Looking for more advice on how to talk about sex with your partner? Or maybe you and your loved one are struggling with another issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn How to Improve Your Relationship!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ourrelationship.com\"><strong>www.ourrelationship.com</strong></a></p>\n",
